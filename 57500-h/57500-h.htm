<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p>Gide’s <i>Principles of Political Economy</i>, of which there are several
translations, is probably better known to English students than
any similar work of foreign origin on the subject, and many
readers of that book will welcome an opportunity of perusing this
volume which Professor Gide has produced in collaboration with
Professor Rist.</p>

<p>The remarkable dearth of literature of this kind in English
may be pleaded in further extenuation of the attempt to present
the work in an English garb, and readers of the Preface will be
able to contrast the position in this country with the very
different condition of things prevailing across the Channel. The
contrast might even be carried a stage farther, and it would
be interesting to speculate upon the historical causes which
have made Germany supreme in the field of economic research
and history, which influenced France in her choice of the
history of theory, and which decreed that England should on
the whole remain faithful to the tradition of the “pure
doctrine.” Can it be that something like a “territorial
division of labour” applies in matters intellectual as well as
economic?</p>

<p>Be that as it may, we can hardly pretend to be satisfied with the
position of our country in this matter of doctrinal history. Of the
nine names mentioned in the Preface, only two are English, namely,
Ashley and Ingram; and it is no disparagement to Ashley’s illuminating
study of mediæval England to say that the main interest of
his work is not doctrinal, and that Cunningham’s name might with
equal appropriateness have been included in the list.</p>

<p>Omitting both Ashley and Cunningham, whose labours have been
largely confined to the realm of economic history, we are thus left
with Ingram’s short but learned work as the sole contribution of
English scholarship to the history of economic thought.</p>

<p>English readers may possibly be puzzled by the omission of
any references, except a stray quotation or two, to Cannan’s <i>History
of the Theories of Production and Distribution</i>. But the microscopic
care with which the earlier theories are examined and elucidated in
that work have resulted in its being regarded as a most valuable
contribution to economic theory itself, and under the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the absence of any reference to it in the Preface is not altogether
surprising.</p>

<p>Our apparent indifference to the development which theory
has undergone in the course of the last 150 years is all the more
difficult to explain when we recall the fact that England has always
been the classic home of theory, both orthodox and socialist, and
our backwardness in this respect contrasts very unfavourably with
the progress made in the kindred study of economic history during
the last twenty-five years under the inspiration of writers like
Ashley, Cunningham, Maitland, Round, and Seebohm.</p>

<p>Most critics are by this time agreed that Ingram’s work, lucid
and learned though it is, is somewhat marred by being written too
exclusively from the standpoint of a Positivist philosopher who
thought he saw in the rapid rise of the Historical school an indisputable
proof of the soundness of the Comtean principles and a
presage of their ultimate triumph.</p>

<p>Complete impartiality in the writing of history, even were it
attainable, may not be altogether desirable, and the present authors
have hastened to disclaim any such qualification. Notwithstanding
this, some of their readers will possibly feel that certain French
schools, both ancient and modern, have been dealt with at disproportionate
length, and that scarcely enough attention has been paid to
certain English and American writers. But it will surely do us little
harm occasionally “to see ourselves as others see us.”</p>

<p>The chief interest of the present volume will probably be found to
consist in the attempt made to give us something like a true perspective
of certain modern theories by connecting them with their
historical antecedents; and we can imagine its later pages being
scanned with a great deal of justifiable curiosity. After all, the
verdict of history upon the achievements of Smith, the measure of
his indebtedness to his immediate predecessors, and the extent to
which the “car of economic progress” was accelerated or retarded
in its movements at the hands of Ricardo and his contemporaries is
fairly well established by this time. On one point only do the present
writers seem to challenge that verdict, namely, in their designation of
Ricardo and Malthus as Pessimists.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with the more modern writers, however. Their
work has not the distinctness of that of the earlier writers, partly
because we are not sufficiently removed from it as yet, and partly
because some of it is obscured by the haze of party strife. But it
may help us to a better understanding of their relative positions to
learn, for example, that the Historical school, which set out on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
career of conquest with a considerable flourish of trumpets, has not
yet succeeded in giving us a new science of Political Economy; that
the Marxian doctrine is already antiquated, in the opinion of certain
members of that school; that the Socialism of the Fabian Society is
merely a recrudescence of Ricardian economics, and that Anarchism
is nothing but a violent form of Liberalism.</p>

<p class="tb">I cannot hope to have succeeded in retaining in this translation
the freshness and vivacity of the original. But I have endeavoured
to make the rendering as accurate as possible; and with this object
in view considerable trouble has been taken to verify the quotations.</p>

<p>As the title-page implies, the work was originally begun at the
suggestion of the late Professor Smart of Glasgow, and to-day more
than ever I am conscious of what I owe to his kindly criticism and
genial encouragement.</p>

<p>The passage of the book through the press has been watched with
assiduous care by Mr. C. C. Wood, who is also responsible for the
Index at the end of the volume. I can scarcely express the measure
of my indebtedness to him. To my friends Mr. W. H. Porter, M.A.,
and Mr. J. G. Williams, M.A., both of Bangor, I am also indebted
for reading some of the proofs.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In the economic curricula of French universities much greater
stress is laid upon the history of economic theory than is the case
anywhere else. Attached to the Faculty of Law in each of these
universities is a separate chair specially devoted to this subject; at
the examination for the doctor’s degree a special paper is set in the
history of theory, and if necessary further proof of competence is
demanded from the student before his final admission to the degree.
At the Sorbonne, where there is only one chair in economics, that
chair is exclusively devoted to the history of doctrines, and the same
is true of the chair recently founded at the École des Hautes Études.</p>

<p>Such prominence given to the history of theory must seem
excessive, especially when it is remembered that in economic
history, as distinct from the history of economics, there is not a
single chair in the whole of France. Those who believe that the
French people are somewhat prone to ideology will not fail to see
in this fact a somewhat unfortunate manifestation of that tendency.
Elsewhere the positions are reversed, the premier place being given
to the study of facts rather than ideas. Extreme partisans of the
historical method, especially the advocates of historical materialism,
regard doctrines and systems as nothing better than a pale reflection
of facts. It is a part of their belief that facts are the only things
that matter, and that the history of the evolution of property or the
rise of the wage system may prove quite as instructive as the history
of the controversies concerning the nature of the right of property
or the wages-fund theory.</p>

<p>Such views as we have just expressed, however, are not altogether
devoid of exaggeration, though of a kind directly opposite to that
which we would naturally impute to them. The influence exerted
by the economic environment, whence even the most abstract
economist gets material for reflection and the exercise of his logical
acumen, is indisputable. The problems which the theorist has to
solve are suggested by the rise of certain phenomena which at one
moment cut a very prominent figure and at another disappear
altogether. Such problems must vary in different places and at
different times. The peculiar economic condition in which England
found herself at the beginning of the nineteenth century had a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
deal to do in directing Ricardo’s thought to the study of the problems
of rent and note issue. But for the advent of machinery, with the
subsequent increase in industrial activity and the parallel growth
of a proletarian class, followed by the recurrence of economic crises,
we may be certain that neither the doctrine of Sismondi nor
that of Karl Marx would ever have seen the light of day. It is
equally safe to assume that the attention which economists have
recently bestowed upon the theory of monopoly is not altogether
unconnected with the contemporary development of the trust
movement.</p>

<p>But, while recognising all this, it is important that we should
remember that facts alone are not sufficient to explain the origin
of any doctrines, even those of social politics, and still less those of
a purely scientific character. Ideas even are not independent of
time and place. Similar conditions in the same epoch of history
have not infrequently given rise to heterogeneous and even antagonistic
theories—J. B. Say’s and Sismondi’s, for example, Bastiat’s
and Proudhon’s, Schulze-Delitzsch’s and Marx’s, Francis Walker’s
and those of Henry George. With what combination of historical
circumstances are we to connect Cournot’s foundation of the
Mathematical school in France, or how are we to account for the
simultaneous discovery in three or four countries of the theory of
final utility?</p>

<p>Although anxious not to seem to make any extravagant claims
for the superiority of the history of theory, we are not ashamed of
repeating our regrets for the comparative neglect of economic
history, and we are equally confident in claiming for our subject
the right to be regarded as a distinct branch of the science.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We
shall accordingly omit all reference to the history of economic facts
and institutions except in so far as such reference seems indispensable
to an understanding of either the appearance or disappearance of such
and such a doctrine or to the better appreciation of the special
prominence which a theory may have held at one moment, although
it is quite unintelligible to us to-day. Sometimes even the facts
are connected with the doctrines, not as causes, but as results, for,
notwithstanding the scepticism of Cournot, who was wont to declare
that the influence exerted by economists upon the course of events
was about equal to the influence exerted by grammarians upon
the development of language, it is impossible not to see a connection
between the commercial treaties of 1860, say, and the teachings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the Manchester school, or between labour legislation and the doctrine
of State Socialism.</p>

<p>To write a history of economic doctrines which should not
exceed the limits of a single volume was to attempt an almost
impossible task, and the authors cannot pretend that they have
accomplished such a difficult feat. Even a very summary exposition
of such doctrines as could not possibly be neglected involved the
omission of others of hardly less importance.</p>

<p>But in the first place it was possible to pass over the pioneers by
taking the latter part of the eighteenth century as the starting-point.
There is no doubt that the beginnings of economic science lie in a
remoter past, but the great currents of economic thought known as
the “schools” only began with the appearance of those two typical
doctrines, individualism and socialism, in the earlier half of the nineteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Moreover, the omission is easily made good, for
it so happens that the earlier periods are those most fully dealt with
in such works as have already appeared on the subject. For the
period of antiquity we have the writings of Espinas<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Souchon;
the mediæval and post-mediæval periods, right up to the eighteenth
century, are treated of in the works of Dubois and Rambaud;
while, in addition to these, we have the writings of Ashley, Ingram,
Hector Denis, Brants, and Cossa, to mention only a few. Modern
theories, as contrasted with those of the earlier periods, have received
comparatively little attention.</p>

<p>Not only have we been obliged to confine our attention to
certain periods, but we have also had to restrict ourselves to certain
countries. We would claim the indulgence of those of our readers
who feel that French doctrines have been considered at disproportionate
length, reminding them that we had French students
chiefly in view when writing. Each author is at liberty to do the
same for his own particular country, and it is better so, for readers
generally desire to learn more about those things of which they
already know something. But, despite the prominence given to
France, England and Germany were bound to receive considerable
attention, although in the case of the latter country we had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
make considerable omissions. With regard to the other countries,
which we were too often obliged to pass by in silence or to mention
only very casually in connection with some theory or other, we are
most anxious not to appear indifferent to the eminent services
rendered by them, and especially Italy and the United States, to
the cause of economic science, both in the past and in the present.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding such restrictions, the field was still too wide,
and we were obliged to focus attention on the minimum number of
names and ideas, with a view to placing them in a better light. Our
ambition has been, not to write as full or detailed a history as we
possibly could, but merely to draw a series of pictures portraying
the more prominent features of some of the more distinct epochs in
the history of economic doctrines.</p>

<p>Such choice must necessarily be somewhat arbitrary, for it is
not always an easy matter to fix upon the best representative of
each doctrine. Especially is this the case in a science like economics,
where the writers, unknown to one another, not infrequently repeat
the same ideas, and it becomes a matter of some difficulty to decide
the claim to priority. But although it may be difficult to hit upon
the exact moment at which a certain idea first made its appearance,
it is comparatively easy to determine when such an idea attracted
general attention or took its place in the hierarchy of accepted
or scarcely disputed truths. This has been our criterion. With
regard to those whose names do not figure in our list, although
quite worthy of a place in the front rank, we cannot believe that
they will suffer much through this temporary eclipse, especially in
view of the partiality of the age for the pioneers. That we are not
unduly optimistic in this matter may be inferred from the numerous
attempts recently made to discover the <i>poetæ minores</i> of the science,
and to make amends for the scant justice done them by the more
biased historians of the past.</p>

<p>Not only was selection necessary in the case of authors, but a
similar procedure had to be applied to the doctrines. It must be
realised, however, that a selection of this character does not warrant
the conclusion that the doctrines dealt with are in any way superior
to those which are not included, either from the standpoint of
moral value, of social utility, or of abstract truth, for we are not
of the number who think with J. B. Say that the history of error
can serve no useful purpose.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We would rather associate ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
with Condillac when he remarks: “It is essential that everyone who
wishes to make some progress in the search for truth should know
something of the mistakes committed by people like himself who
thought they were extending the boundaries of knowledge.” The
study of error would be thoroughly well justified even though the
result were simply a healthy determination to avoid it in future. It
would be even more so if Herbert Spencer’s version of the saying of
Shakespeare, that there is no species of error without some germ of
truth in it, should prove correct. One cannot, moreover, be said to
possess a knowledge of any doctrine or to understand it until one
knows something of its history, and of the pitfalls that lay in the path
of those who first formulated it. A truth received as if it has fallen
from the sky, without any knowledge of the efforts whereby it has
been acquired, is like an ingot of gold got without toil—of little
profit.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is to be remembered that this book is intended
primarily for students, and that it may be useful to show them in
what respects certain doctrines are open to criticism, either from
the point of view of logic or of observation. We have attempted
to confine such criticism within the strictest limits, partly because we
did not wish the volume to become too bulky, and partly because
we felt that what is important for our readers are not our own
opinions, but the opinions of the masters of the science with which
we deal. Wherever possible these have been given the opportunity
of speaking for themselves, and for this reason we have not been
afraid to multiply quotations.</p>

<p>A special effort has been made to bring into prominence such
doctrines—whether true or false—as have contributed to the
formation of ideas generally accepted at the present time, or such
as are connected with these in the line of direct descent. In other
words, the book is an attempt to give an answer to the following
questions: Who is responsible for formulating those principles that
constitute the framework—whether provisionary or definitive it is
not for us to determine—of economics as at present taught? At
what period were these principles first enunciated, and what were
the circumstances which accounted for their enunciation just at
that period? Thus we have thought it not altogether out of place
to pay some attention to those ideas which, although only on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
the borderland of economics, have exercised considerable influence
either upon theory itself, upon legislation, or upon economic thought
in general. We refer to such movements as Christian Socialism,
Solidarism, and Anarchism. Had we considered it advisable to
retain the official title by which this kind of work is generally known,
we should have had to describe it as <i>A History of the Origin and
Evolution of Contemporary Economic Doctrines</i>.</p>

<p>The plan of a history of this kind was a matter that called for
some amount of deliberation. It was felt that, being a history, fairly
close correspondence with the chronological order was required, which
meant either taking a note of every individual doctrine, or breaking up
the work into as many distinct histories as there are separate schools.
The former procedure would necessitate giving a review of a great
number of doctrines in a single chapter, which could only have the
effect of leaving a very confused impression upon the reader’s mind.
The alternative proposal is open to the objection that, instead of
giving us a general outline, it merely treats us to a series of monographs,
which prevents our realising the nature of that fundamental
unity that in all periods of history binds every doctrine together,
similar and dissimilar alike. We have attempted to avoid the inconveniences
and to gain something of the advantages offered by these
alternative methods by grouping the doctrines into families according
to their descent, and presenting them in their chronological order.
This does not mean that we have classified them according to the
date of their earliest appearance; it simply means that we have
taken account of such doctrines as have reached a certain degree of
maturity. There is always some culminating-point in the history of
every doctrine, and in deciding to devote a separate chapter to some
special doctrine we have always had such a climacteric in mind.
Nor have we scrupled to abandon the chronological order when
the exigencies of the exposition seemed to demand it.</p>

<p>The first epoch comprises the end of the eighteenth and the
beginning of the nineteenth centuries. It deals mainly with the
founders of Classical political economy, with the Physiocrats, Smith
and Say, and with Malthus and Ricardo, the two writers whose
gloomy forebodings were to cloud the glory of the “natural order.”</p>

<p>The second epoch covers the first half of the nineteenth century.
The “adversaries” include all those writers who either challenged
or in some way disputed the principles which had been laid down
by their predecessors. To these writers five chapters are devoted,
dealing respectively with Sismondi, Saint-Simon, the Associative
Socialists, List, and Proudhon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>A third epoch deals with the middle of the nineteenth century
and the triumph of the Liberal school, which had hitherto withstood
every attack, though not without making some concessions.
It so happened that the fundamental doctrines of this school were
definitely formulated about the same time, though in a very different
fashion, of course, in the <i>Principles</i> of Stuart Mill in England and
the <i>Harmonies</i> of Bastiat in France.</p>

<p>The second half of the nineteenth century constitutes a fourth
period. Those who dissented from the Liberalism of the previous
epoch are responsible for the schisms that began to manifest themselves
in four different directions at this time. The Historical
school advocates the employment of the inductive method, and
the State Socialists press the claims of a new social policy. Marxism
is an attack upon the scientific basis of the science, and Christian
Socialism a challenge to its ethical implications.</p>

<p>A fifth epoch comprises the end of the nineteenth century and
the beginning of the twentieth. The heading “Recent Doctrines”
includes several theories that are already well known to us, but
which seem transfigured—or disfigured, as some would prefer to put
it—in their new surroundings. The Hedonistic doctrine and the
theory of rent represent a kind of revision of the Classical theories.
Solidarism is an attempt to bridge the gap that exists between
individualism and socialism, whilst Anarchism can only be described
as a kind of impassioned Liberalism.</p>

<p>This order of succession must not be taken to imply that each
antecedent doctrine has either been eliminated by some subsequent
doctrine or else incorporated in it. The rise of the Historical
school in the middle of the nineteenth century, for example, happened
to be contemporaneous with the triumph of the Liberal school and
the revival of Optimism. In a similar fashion the new Liberalism
of the Austrian school was coincident with the advent of State
intervention and the rise of Collectivism.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, help noticing a certain rhythmical sequence
in this evolutionary process. Thus we find the Classical doctrine,
as it is called, outlined in the earliest draft of the science, but disappearing
under the stress of more or less socialistic doctrines, to
reappear in a new guise later on. There is no necessity for regarding
this as a mere ebb and flow such as distinguishes the fortunes of
political parties under a parliamentary <i>régime</i>. Such alternation in
the history of a doctrine has its explanation not so much in the
character of the doctrine itself as in the favour of public opinion,
which varies with the fickleness of the winds of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>But doctrines and systems have a vitality of their own which
is altogether independent of the vagaries of fashion. It were better
to regard their history, like all histories of ideas, as a kind of struggle
for existence. At one moment conflicting doctrines seem to dwell
in harmony side by side, content to divide the empire of knowledge
between them. Another moment witnesses them rushing at each
other with tumultuous energy. It may happen that in the course
of the struggle some of the doctrines are worsted and disappear
altogether. But more often than not their conflicting interests are
reconciled and the enmity is lost in the unity of a higher synthesis.
And so it may happen that a doctrine which everybody thought
was quite dead may rise with greater vigour than ever.</p>

<p>The bibliography of the subject is colossal. In addition to the
general histories, which are already plentiful, the chapters devoted
to the subject in every treatise on political economy, and the
numerous articles which have appeared in various reviews, there
is scarcely an author, however obscure, who is not the subject
of a biography. To have attempted to enumerate all these
works would merely have meant increasing the bulk of the book
without being able to pretend that our list was exhaustive. It
is scarcely necessary to add that this meant that we had to confine
ourselves to the work done by the “heroes” of this volume.
Their commentators and critics only came in for our attention
when we had to borrow either an expression or an idea directly
from them or when we felt it necessary that the reader should
fill up the gaps left by our exposition. This accounts for the
number of names which had to be relegated to the foot-notes.
But such deliberate excision must not prevent our recognising at
the outset the debt that we owe to the many writers who have
traversed the ground before us. They have facilitated our task
and have a perfect right to regard themselves as our collaborators.
We feel certain that they will find that their labours have not been
ignored or forgotten.</p>

<p>Although this book, so far as the general task of preparation
and revision is concerned, must be regarded as the result of a
collective effort on the part of the two authors whose names are
subjoined, the actual work of composition was undertaken by each
writer separately. The Contents will sufficiently indicate the nature
of this division of labour.</p>

<p>The authors refuse to believe that collaboration in the production
of a scientific history of ideas need imply absolute agreement
on every question that comes up for consideration. Especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
is this the case with the doctrines of political and social economy
outlined herein; each of the authors has retained the fullest right
of independent judgment on all these matters. Consequently any
undue reserve or any extravagant enthusiasm shown for some of
these doctrines must be taken as an expression of the personal
predilection of the signatory of the particular article.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I_THE_PHYSIOCRATS">CHAPTER I: THE PHYSIOCRATS</h3>

<p>Political Economy as the name of a special science is the invention
of one Antoine de Montchrétien, who first employed the term about
the beginning of the seventeenth century. Not until the middle of the
eighteenth century, however, does the connotation of the word in
any way approach to modern usage. A perusal of the article on
Political Economy which appeared in the <i>Grande Encyclopédie</i> of
1755 will help us to appreciate the difference. That article was
contributed by no less a person than Jean Jacques Rousseau, but
its medley of politics and economics seems utterly strange to us.
Nowadays it is customary to regard the adjective “political” as
unnecessary, and an attempt is made to dispense with it by employing
the terms “economic science” or “social economics,” but this article
clearly proves that it was not always devoid of significance. It also
reveals the interesting fact that the science has always been chiefly
concerned with the business side of the State, especially with
the material welfare of the citizens—“with the fowl in the pot,”
as Henry IV put it. Even Smith never succeeded in getting quite
beyond this point of view, for he declares that “the object of the
political economy of every nation is to increase the riches and the
power of that country.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But the counsels given and the recipes offered for attaining
the desired end were as diverse as they were uncertain. One school,
known as the Mercantilist, believed that a State, like an individual,
must secure the maximum of silver and gold before it could become
wealthy. Happy indeed was a country like Spain that had discovered
a Peru, or Holland, which, in default of mines, could procure
gold from the foreigner in exchange for its spices. Foreign trade
really seemed a quite inexhaustible mine. Other writers, who were
socialists in fact though not in name—for that term is of later invention—thought
that happiness could only be found in a more equal
distribution of wealth, in the abolition or limitation of the rights of
private property, or in the creation of a new society on the basis
of a new social contract—in short, in the foundation of the Utopian
commonwealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Quesnay appeared. Quesnay was
a doctor by profession, who now, when on the verge of old age, had
turned his attention to the study of “rural economy”—the problem
of the land and the means of subsistence.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Boldly declaring that
the solution of the problem had always lain ready to hand, needing
neither inventing nor discovering, he further maintained that all
social relations into which men enter, far from being haphazard,
are, on the contrary, admirably regulated and controlled. To those
who took the trouble to think, the laws governing human associations
seemed almost self-evident, and the difficulties they involved
no greater than the difficulties presented by the laws of geometry.
So admirable were these laws in every respect that once they
were thoroughly known they were certain to command allegiance.
Dupont de Nemours cannot be said to have exaggerated when, in
referring to this doctrine, he spoke of it as “very novel indeed.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It is not too much to say that this marks the beginning of a new
science—the science of Political Economy. The age of forerunners
is past. Quesnay and his disciples must be considered the real
founders of the science. It is true that their direct descendants,
the French economists, very inconsiderately allowed the title to
pass to Adam Smith, but foreign economists have again restored
it to France, to remain in all probability definitely hers. But, as is
the case with most sciences, there is not very much to mark the date of
its birth or to determine the stock from which it sprang; all that
we can confidently say is that the Physiocrats were certainly the first
to grasp the conception of a unified science of society. In other words,
they were the first to realise that all social facts are linked together in
the bonds of inevitable laws, which individuals and Governments
would obey if they were once made known to them. It may, of course,
be pointed out that such a providential conception of economic laws
has little in common with the ordinary naturalistic or deterministic
standpoint of the science, and that several of the generalisations are
simply the product of their own imaginations. It must also be admitted
that Smith had far greater powers of observation, as well as a
superior gift of lucid exposition, and altogether made a more notable
contribution to the science. Still, it was the Physiocrats who constructed
the way along which Smith and the writers of the hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
years which follow have all marched. Moreover, we know that but for
the death of Quesnay in 1774—two years before the publication of
the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>—Smith would have dedicated his masterpiece
to him.</p>

<p>The Physiocrats must also be credited with the foundation of
the earliest “school” of economists in the fullest sense of the
term. The entrance of this small group of men into the arena of
history is a most touching and significant spectacle. So complete
was the unanimity of doctrine among them that their very names
and even their personal characteristics are for ever enshrouded by
the anonymity of a collective name.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Their publications follow each other pretty closely for a period
of twenty years, from 1756 to 1778.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Turgot was the only literary person among them, but like his
<i>confrères</i> he was devoid of wit, though the age was noted for
its humorists. On the whole they were a sad and solemn sect,
and their curious habit of insisting upon logical consistency—as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
if they were the sole depositaries of eternal truth—must often
have been very tiresome. They soon fell an easy prey to the
caustic sarcasm of Voltaire.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But despite all this they enjoyed
a great reputation among their more eminent contemporaries.
Statesmen, ambassadors, and a whole galaxy of royal personages,
including the Margrave of Baden, who attempted to apply their
doctrines in his own realm, the Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany,
the Emperor Joseph II of Austria, Catherine, the famous Empress
of Russia, Stanislaus, King of Poland, and Gustavus III of Sweden,
were numbered among their auditors. Lastly, and most unexpectedly
of all, they were well received by the Court ladies at
Versailles. In a word, Physiocracy became the rage. All this may
seem strange to us, but there are several considerations which may
well be kept in view. The society of the period, <i>raffiné</i> and licentious
as it was, took the same delight in the “rural economy” of the Physiocrats
as it did in the pastorals of Trianon or Watteau. Perhaps it
gleaned some comfort from the thought of an unchangeable “natural
order,” just when the political and social edifice was giving way
beneath its feet. It may be that its curiosity was roused by that
terse saying which Quesnay wrote at the head of the <i>Tableau
economique</i>: “Pauvres paysans, pauvre royaume! Pauvre royaume,
pauvre roi!” or that it felt in those words the sough of a new breeze,
not very threatening as yet, but a forerunner of the coming storm.</p>

<p>An examination of the doctrine, or the essential principles as they
called them, must precede a consideration of the system or the proposed
application of those principles.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<h5 id="heading1">I: THE NATURAL ORDER</h5>

<p>The essence of the Physiocratic system lay in their conception of
the “natural order.” <i>L’Ordre naturel et essential des Societés politiques</i>
is the title of Mercier de la Rivière’s book, and Dupont de Nemours
defined Physiocracy as “the science of the natural order.”</p>

<p>What are we to understand by these terms?</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the term “natural order” is
meant to emphasise the contrast between it and the artificial social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
order voluntarily created upon the basis of a social contract.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But a
purely negative definition is open to many different interpretations.</p>

<p>In the first place, this “natural order” may be conceived as a
state of nature in opposition to a civilised state regarded as an
artificial creation. To discover what such a “natural order” really
was like man must have recourse to his origins.</p>

<p>Quotations from the Physiocrats in support of this view might
easily be cited.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This interpretation has the further distinction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
being in accord with the spirit of the age. The worship of the
“noble savage” was a feature of the end of the eighteenth century.
It pervades the literature of the period, and the cult which began with
the tales of Voltaire, Diderot, and Marmontel reappears in the
anarchist writers of to-day. As an interpretation of the Physiocratic
position, however, it must be unhesitatingly rejected, for no one bore
less resemblance to a savage than a Physiocrat. They all of them
lived highly respectable lives as magistrates, <i>intendants</i>, priests, and
royal physicians, and were completely captivated by ideas of orderliness,
authority, sovereignty, and property—none of them conceptions
compatible with a savage state. “Property, security, and liberty
constitutes the whole of the social order.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They never acquiesced
in the view that mankind suffered loss in passing from the state
of nature into the social state; neither did they hold to Rousseau’s
belief that there was greater freedom in the natural state, although its
dangers were such that men were willing to sacrifice something in
order to be rid of them, but that nevertheless in entering upon the new
state something had been lost which could never be recovered.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> All
this was a mere illusion in the opinion of the Physiocrats. Nothing
was lost, everything was to be gained, by passing from a state of nature
into the civilised state.</p>

<p>In the second place, the term “natural order” might be taken
to mean that human societies are subject to natural laws such as
govern the physical world or exercise sway over animal or organic
life. From this standpoint the Physiocrats must be regarded as the
forerunners of the organic sociologists. Such interpretation seems
highly probable because Dr. Quesnay through his study of “animal
economy” (the title of one of his works) and the circulation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
blood was already familiar with these ideas. Social and animal
economy, both, might well have appeared to him in much the same
light as branches of physiology. From physiology to Physiocracy
was not a very great step. At any rate, the Physiocrats succeeded
in giving prominence to the idea of the interdependence of all social
classes and of their final dependence upon nature. And this we
might almost say was a change tantamount to a transformation from
a moral to a natural science.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Even this explanation seems to us insufficient. Dupont, in the
words which we have quoted in the footnote below, seems to imply that
the laws of the beehive and the ant-hill are imposed by common
consent and for mutual benefit. Animal society, so it seemed
to him, was founded upon social contract. But such a conception
of “law” is very far removed from the one usually adopted by the
natural sciences, by physicians and biologists, say. And, as a matter
of fact, the Physiocrats were anything but determinists. They
neither believed that the “natural order” imposed itself like gravitation
nor imagined that it could ever be realised in human society
as it is in the hive or the ant-hill. They saw that the latter were
well-ordered communities, while human society at its present stage
is disordered, because man is free whereas the animal is not.</p>

<p>What are we to make of this “natural order” then? The
“natural order,” so the Physiocrats maintained, is the order which
God has ordained for the happiness of mankind. It is the providential
order.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> To understand it is our first duty—to bring our lives
into conformity with it is our next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>But can a knowledge of the “order” ever be acquired by men?
To this they reply that the distinctive mark of this “order” is its
obviousness. This word occurs on almost every page they wrote.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Still, the self-evident must in some way be apprehended. The most
brilliant light can be seen only by the eye. By what organ can
this be sensed? By instinct, by conscience, or by reason? Will
a divine voice by means of a supernatural revelation show us the
way of truth, or will it be Nature’s hand that shall lead us in the
blessed path? The Physiocrats seem to have ignored this question,
for every one of them indifferently gives his own answer, regardless
of the fact that it may contradict another’s. Mercier de la Rivière
recalls the saying of St. John concerning the “Light which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.” This may be taken to be
an internal light set by God in the heart of every man to enable him to
choose his path. Quesnay, so Dupont affirms, “must have seen
that man had only to examine himself to find within him an inarticulate
conception of these laws. In other words, introspection
clearly shows that men are unwittingly guided by an “inherent”
knowledge of Physiocracy.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But, after all, it seems that this
intuitive perception is insufficient to reveal the full glory of the
order. For Quesnay declared that a knowledge of its laws must
be enforced upon men, and this afforded a <i>raison d’être</i> for an
educational system which was to be under the direct control of
the Government.</p>

<p>To sum up, we may say that the “natural order” was that
order which seemed obviously the best, not to any individual
whomsoever, but to rational, cultured, liberal-minded men like the
Physiocrats. It was not the product of the observation of external
facts; it was the revelation of a principle within. And this is one
reason why the Physiocrats showed such respect for property and
authority. It seemed to them that these formed the very basis
of the “natural order.”</p>

<p>It was just because the “natural order” was “supernatural,”
and so raised above the contingencies of everyday life, that it
seemed to them to be endowed with all the grandeur of the geometrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
order, with its double attributes of universality and immutability.
It remained the same for all times, and for all men. Its
fiat was “unique, eternal, invariable, and universal.” Divine in its
origin, it was universal in its scope, and its praises were sung in
litanies that might rival the <i>Ave Maria</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Speaking of its universality,
Turgot writes as follows: “Whoever is unable to overlook
the accidental separation of political states one from another, or
to forget their diverse institutions, will never treat a question of
political economy satisfactorily.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Referring to its immutability,
he adds: “It is not enough to know what is or what has been; we
must also know what ought to be. The rights of man are not
founded upon history: they are rooted in his nature.”</p>

<p>It looked as if this dogmatic optimism would dominate the whole
Classical school, especially the French writers, and that natural
law would usurp the functions of Providence. To-day it is everywhere
discredited, but when it first loomed above the horizon its
splendour dazzled all eyes. Hence the many laudatory remarks,
which to us seem hyperbolical, if not actually ridiculous.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But
it was no small thing to found a new science, to set up a new aim and
a fresh ideal, to lay down the framework which others were to fill in.</p>

<p>It was the practical results, however, that revealed the full
powers of the “natural order.” It so happened that the mass of
regulations which constituted the old <i>régime</i> fell to the ground
before its onslaughts almost immediately, and it all came about in
this fashion.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the “natural order” was not sufficient. Daily
life must also conform to the knowledge. Nothing could be easier
than this, for “if the order really were the most advantageous”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
every man could be trusted to find out for himself the best way of
attaining it without coercion of any kind.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>This psychological balance which every individual was supposed
to carry within himself, and which, as the basis of the Neo-Classical
school, is known as the Hedonistic principle, is admirably described
by Quesnay.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> “To secure the greatest amount of pleasure with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the least possible outlay should be the aim of all economic effort.”
And this was what the “order” aimed at. “When every one does
this the natural order, instead of being endangered, will be all the
better assured.” It is of the very essence of that order that the
particular interest of the individual can never be separated from the
common interest of all, but this happens only under a free system.
“The movements of society are spontaneous and not artificial, and
the desire for joy which manifests itself in all its activities unwittingly
drives it towards the realisation of the ideal type of State.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
This is <i>laissez-faire</i> pure and simple.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>These famous formulæ have been so often repeated and criticised
since that they appear somewhat trite to-day. But it is certain
that they were not so at the time. It is easy to laugh at their social
philosophy, to mock at its <i>naïveté</i> and simplicity, and to show that
such supposed harmony of interests between men does not exist, that
the interests of individuals do not always coincide with those of the
community, and that the private citizen is not always the best
judge even of his own interests. It was perhaps necessary that
the science should be born of such extreme optimism. No science
can be constructed without some amount of faith in a pre-established
order.</p>

<p>Moreover, <i>laissez-faire</i> does not of necessity mean that
nothing will be done. It is not a doctrine of passivity or fatalism.
There will be ample scope for individual effort, for it simply means
leaving an open field and securing fair play for everyone, free from
all fear lest his own interests should injure other people’s or in any
way prejudice those of the State. It is true that there will not be
much work for the Government, but the task of that body will by no
means be a light one, especially if it intends carrying out the Physiocratic
programme. This included upholding the rights of private
property and individual liberty by removing all artificial barriers,
and punishing all those who threatened the existence of any of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
rights; while, most important of all, there was the duty of giving
instruction in the laws of the “natural order.”</p>

<h5 id="heading2">II: THE NET PRODUCT</h5>

<p>Every social fact had a place within the “natural order” of the
Physiocrats. Such a wide generalisation would have entitled them
to be regarded as the founders of sociology rather than of economics.
But there was included one purely economic phenomenon
which attracted their attention at an early stage, and so completely
captivated their imaginations as to lead them on a false quest. This
was the predominant position which land occupied as an agent of
production—the most erroneous and at the same time the most
characteristic doctrine in the whole Physiocratic system.</p>

<p>Every productive undertaking of necessity involves certain
outgoings—a certain loss. In other words, some amount of wealth
is destroyed in the production of new wealth—an amount that
ought to be subtracted from the amount of new wealth produced.
This difference, measuring as it does the excess of the one over the
other, constitutes the net increase of wealth, known since the time
of the Physiocrats as the “net product.”</p>

<p>The Physiocrats believed that this “net product” was confined
to one class of production only, namely, agriculture. Here alone,
so it seemed to them, the wealth produced was greater than the
wealth consumed. Barring accidents, the labourer reaped more
than he consumed, even if we included in his consumption his maintenance
throughout a whole year, and not merely during the seasons
of harvest and tilth. It was because agricultural production had
this unique and marvellous power of yielding a “net product” that
economy was possible and civilisation a fact.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It was not true of
any other class of production, either of commerce or of transport,
where it was very evident that man’s labour produced nothing,
but merely replaced or transferred the products already produced.
Neither was it true of manufacture, where the artisan simply combined
or otherwise modified the raw material.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>It is true that such transfer or accretion of matter may increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the value of the product, but only in proportion to the amount of
wealth which had to be consumed in order to produce it; because
the price of manual labour is always equal to the cost of the necessaries
consumed by the worker. All that we have in this case, however,
is a collection of superimposed values with some raw material
thrown into the bargain. But, as Mercier de la Rivière put it,
“addition is not multiplication.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Consequently, industry was voted sterile. This implied no
contempt for industry and commerce. “Far from being useless,
these are the arts that supply the luxuries as well as the necessaries
of life, and upon these mankind is dependent both for its preservation
and for its well-being.”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> They are unproductive in the sense that
they produce no “extra” wealth.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out, on the other hand, that the “gains,” both
in industry and commerce, are far in excess of those of agriculture.
All this was immaterial to the Physiocrats, for “they were gained,
not produced.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Such gains simply represented wealth transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
from the agricultural to the industrial classes.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The agricultural
classes furnished the artisans not only with raw material, but also
with the necessaries of life. The artisans were simply the domestic
servants, or, to use Turgot’s phrase, the hirelings of the agriculturists.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Strictly speaking, the latter could keep the whole net
product to themselves, but finding it more convenient they entrust
the making of their clothes, the erection of their houses, and the
production of their implements to the artisans, giving them a portion
of the net product as remuneration.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It is possible, of course,
that, like many servants in fine houses, the latter manage to make a
very good living at their masters’ expense.</p>

<p>The “sterile classes” in Physiocratic parlance simply signifies
those who draw their incomes second-hand. The Physiocrats had
the good sense to try to give an explanation of this unfortunate
term, which threatened to discredit their system altogether, and
which it seemed unfair to apply to a whole class that had done more
than any other towards enriching the nation.</p>

<p>It is a debatable point whether the Physiocrats attributed
this virtue of furnishing a net product solely to agriculture or whether
they intended it to apply to extractive industries, such as mining
and fishing. They seem to apply it in a general way to mines, but
the references are rare and not infrequently contradictory. We can
understand their hesitating, for, on the one hand, mines undoubtedly
give us new wealth in the form of raw materials, just as the land or
sea does; on the other hand, the fruits of the earth and the treasures
of the deep are not so easily exhausted as mines. Turgot put it
excellently when he said, “The land produces fruit annually, but
a mine produces no fruit. The mine itself is the garnered fruit,”
and he concludes that mines, like industrial undertakings, give no
net product, that if any one had any claim to that product it would
be the owner of the soil, but that in any case the surplus would be
almost insignificant.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>This essential difference which the Physiocrats sought to establish
between agricultural and industrial production was at bottom
theological. The fruits of the earth are given by God, while the
products of the arts are wrought by man, who is powerless to create.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
The reply is obvious. God would still be creator if He decreed to
give us our clothes instead of our daily bread. And, although
man cannot create matter, but simply transform it, it is important
to remember that the cultivation of the soil, like the fashioning of
iron or wood, is merely a process of transformation. They failed to
grasp the truth which Lavoisier was to demonstrate so clearly,
namely, that in nature nothing is ever created and nothing lost.
A grain of corn sown in a field obtains the materials for the ear
from the soil and atmosphere, transmuting them to suit its own
purpose, just as the baker, out of that same corn, combined with
water, salt, and yeast, will make bread.</p>

<p>But they were sufficiently clear-sighted to see that all natural
products, including even corn, were influenced by the varying
condition of the markets, and that if prices fell very low the net
product disappeared altogether. In view of such facts can it still
be said that the earth produces real value or that its produce differs
in any essential respects from the products of industry?</p>

<p>The Physiocrats possibly thought that the <i>bon prix</i>—<i>i.e.</i> the
price which yielded a surplus over and above cost of production—was
a normal effect of the “natural order.” Whenever the price
fell to the level of the cost of production it was a sure sign that the
“order” had been destroyed. Under these circumstances there
was nothing remarkable in the disappearance of the net product.
This is doubtless the significance of Quesnay’s enigmatic saying:
“Abundance and cheapness are not wealth, scarcity and dearness
are misery, abundance and dearness are opulence.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>But if the <i>bon prix</i> simply measures the difference between
the value of the product and its cost of production, then it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
more common in agriculture than in other modes of production.
Nor does it extend over a longer period in the one case than in the
other, provided competition be operative in both cases; on the contrary,
it will become manifest in the one case as easily as in the
other, especially if there be any scarcity. It remains to be seen
then whether monopoly values are more prevalent in agricultural
production than in industrial. In a very general way, seeing that
there is only a limited quantity of land, we may answer in the
affirmative, and admit a certain degree of validity in the Physiocratic
theory. But the establishment of protective rights and the
occurrence of agricultural crises clearly prove that competition also
has some influence upon the amount of that revenue.</p>

<p>The net product was just an illusion. The essence of production
is not the creation of matter, but simply the accretion of value.
But it is not difficult to appreciate the nature of the illusion if we
recall the circumstances, and try to visualise the kind of society
with which the Physiocrats were acquainted. One section of the
community, consisting solely of nobility and clergy, lived upon the
rents which the land yielded. Their luxurious lives would have
been impossible if the earth did not yield something over and above
the amount consumed by the peasant. It is curious that the Physiocrats,
while they regarded the artisans as nothing better than
servants who depended for their very existence upon the agriculturists,
failed to recognise the equally complete dependence of the
worthless proprietor upon his tenants. If there had existed
instead a class of business men living in ease and luxury, and
drawing their dividends, it is quite possible that the Physiocrats
would have concluded that there was a net product in industrial
enterprise.</p>

<p>So deeply rooted was this idea of nature, or God operating through
nature, as the only source of value that we find traces of it even in
Adam Smith. Not until we come to Ricardo do we have a definite
contradiction of it. With Ricardo, rent, the income derived from
land, instead of being regarded as a blessing of nature—the <i>Alma
Parens</i>—which was bound to grow as the “natural order” extended
its sway, is simply looked upon as the inevitable result of the limited
extent and growing sterility of the land. No longer is it a free gift
of God to men, but a pre-imposed tax which the consumer has to
pay the proprietor. No longer is it the net product; henceforth
it is known as rent.</p>

<p>As to the epithet “sterile,” which was applied to every kind of
work other than agriculture, we shall find that it has been superseded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>,
and that the attribute “productive” has been successively applied to
every class of work—first to industry, then to commerce, and finally
to the liberal professions. Even if it were true that industrial undertakings
only yield the equivalent of the value consumed, that is
not enough to justify the epithet “sterile,” unless, as Adam Smith
wittily remarks, we are by analogy to consider every marriage
sterile which does not result in the birth of more than two children.
To invoke the distinction between addition and multiplication is
useless, because arithmetic teaches us that multiplication is simply
an abridged method of adding.</p>

<p>It seems very curious that that kind of wealth which appeared
to the Physiocrats to be the most legitimate and the most superior
kind should be just the one that owed nothing to labour, and which
later on, under the name of rent, seems the most difficult to justify.</p>

<p>But we must not conclude that the Physiocratic theory of the
net product possessed no scientific value.</p>

<p>It was a challenge to the economic doctrines of the time, especially
Mercantilism. The Mercantilists thought that the only way to
increase wealth was to exploit neighbours and colonists, but they
failed to see that commerce and agriculture afforded equally satisfactory
methods. Nor must we forget the Physiocrats’ influence upon
practical politics. Sully, the French minister, betrays evidence of
their influence when he remarks that the only two sources of national
wealth are land and labour. Let us also remember that, despite
some glaring mistakes, agriculture has never lost the pre-eminence
which they gave it, and that the recent revival of agricultural
Protection is directly traceable to their influence. They were
always staunch Free Traders themselves, but we can hardly blame
them for not being sufficiently sanguine to expect such whole-hearted
acceptance of their views as to anticipate some of the more
curious developments of their doctrines. It is almost certain that
if they were living to-day they would not be found supporting the
Protectionist movement. At least this is the opinion of M. Oncken,
the economist, who has made the most thorough study of their
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Although the Physiocratic distinction between agriculture and
industry was largely imaginary, it is nevertheless true that agriculture
does possess certain special features, such as the power of engendering
the forces of life, whether vegetable or animal. This mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
force, which under the term “nature” was only very dimly understood
by the Physiocrats, and still is too often confused with
the physico-chemical forces, does really possess some characteristics
which help us to differentiate between agriculture and industry.
At some moments agriculture seems inferior because its returns are
limited by the exigencies of time and place; but more often superior
because agriculture alone can produce the necessaries of life. This
is no insignificant fact; but we are trenching on the difficult problems
connected with the name of Malthus.</p>

<h5 id="heading3">III: THE CIRCULATION OF WEALTH</h5>

<p>The Physiocrats were the first to attempt a synthesis of distribution.
They were anxious to know—and it was surely a praiseworthy
ambition—how wealth passed from one class in society to another,
why it always followed the same routes, whose meanderings they
were successful in unravelling, and how this continual circulation,
as Turgot said, “constituted the very life of the body politic, just as
the circulation of the blood did of the physical.”</p>

<p>A scholar like Quesnay, the author of the work on animal
economy<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and a diligent student of Harvey’s new discovery, was
precisely the man to carry the biological idea over into the realm
of sociology. He made use of the idea in his <i>Tableau économique</i>,
which is simply a graphic representation of the way in which the
circulation of wealth takes place. The appearance of this table caused
an enthusiasm among his contemporaries that is almost incredible,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
although Professor Hector Denis declares that he is almost ready
to share in Mirabeau’s admiration.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>We know by this time that this circulation is much more complicated
than the Physiocrats believed, but it is still worth while
to give an outline of their conception.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Quesnay distinguishes three social classes:</p>

<p>1. A productive class consisting entirely of agriculturists—perhaps
also of fishermen and miners.</p>

<p>2. A proprietary class, including not only landed proprietors,
but also any who have the slightest title to sovereignty of any kind—a
survival of feudalism, where the two ideas of sovereignty and
property are always linked together.</p>

<p>3. A sterile class, consisting of merchants and manufacturers,
together with domestic servants and members of the liberal
professions.</p>

<p>The first class, being the only productive class, must supply all
that flow of wealth whose course we are now to follow. Let us suppose,
then—the figures are Quesnay’s and seem sufficiently near the
facts—that the value of the total wealth produced equals 5 milliard
francs. Of this 5 milliards 2 milliards are necessary for the upkeep
of the members of this class and its oxen during harvest and sowing.
This portion does not circulate. It simply remains where it was
produced. The produce representing the remaining 3 milliards is sold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
But agricultural products alone do not suffice for the upkeep of Class 1.
Manufactured goods, clothes, and boots also are required, and these are
got from the industrial classes, for which a milliard francs is given.</p>

<p>There remain just 2 milliards, which go to the landowners and the
Government in rents and taxes. By and by we shall see how they
attempted to justify this apparent parasitism.</p>

<p>Let us pass on to consider the propertied class. It manages
to live upon the 2 milliards which it receives by way of rents, and
it lives well. Its food it must obtain from the agricultural class
(unless, of course, the rents are paid in kind), and for this it possibly
pays a milliard francs. It also requires manufactured goods, which
it must get from the sterile class, and for which it pays another
milliard francs. This completes their account.</p>

<p>As to the sterile class, it produces nothing, and so, unlike the
preceding class, it can only get its necessaries second-hand from the
productive class. These may be got in two ways: a milliard from
the agricultural class in payment for manufactured goods and
another milliard from the landed proprietors. The latter milliard
being one of the two which the landed proprietors got from the agriculturists,
has in this way described the complete circle.</p>

<p>The 2 milliards obtained as salaries by the sterile class are
employed in buying the necessaries of life and the raw material
of industry. And since it is only the productive class that can
procure these necessaries and raw materials, this 2 milliards passes
into the hands of the agriculturists. The 2 milliards, in short,
return to their starting-point. Adding the milliard already paid
by the landed proprietors to the 2 milliards’ worth of products
unsold, the total of 5 milliards is replaced in the hands of the productive
class, and so the process goes on indefinitely.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>This <i>résumé</i> gives but a very imperfect idea of the vast complexities
and difficulties involved in tracing the growth of revenues—an
evolution which the Physiocrats followed with the enthusiasm
of children. They imagined that it was all very real.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
rediscovery of their millions intoxicated them, but, like many of the
mathematical economists of to-day, they forgot that at the end of
their calculations they only had what they had assumed at the
beginning. It is very evident that the table proves nothing as to
the essential point in their system, namely, whether there really
exist a productive and a sterile class.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The most interesting thing in the Physiocratic scheme of distribution
is not the particular demonstration which they gave of it, but
the emphasis which they laid upon the fact of the circulation of
wealth taking place in accordance with certain laws, and the way in
which the revenue of each class was determined by this circulation.</p>

<p>The singular position which the proprietors hold in this tripartite
division of society is one of the most curious features of the
system.</p>

<p>Anyone examining the table in a non-Physiocratic fashion,
but simply viewing it in the modern spirit, must at once feel surprised
and disappointed to find that the class which enjoys two-fifths of
the national revenue does nothing in return for it. We should
not have been surprised if such glaring parasitism had given to
the work of the Physiocrats a distinctly socialistic tone. But they
were quite impervious to all such ideas. They never appreciated
the weakness of the landowners’ position, and they always treated
them with the greatest reverence. The epithet “sterile” is applied,
not to them, but to manufacturers and artisans! Property is the
foundation-stone of the “natural order.” The proprietors have been
entrusted with the task of supplying the staff of life, and are endued
with a kind of priestly sacredness. It is from their hands that all of
us receive the elements of nutrition. It is a “divine” institution—the
word is there.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Such idolatry needs some explanation.</p>

<p>One might have expected—even from their own point of view—that
the premier position would have been given to the class which
they termed productive, <i>i.e.</i> to the cultivators of the soil, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
mostly farmers and <i>métayers</i>. The land was not of their making, it
is true. They had simply received it from the proprietors. This
latter class takes precedence because God has willed that it should
be the first dispenser of all wealth.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>There is no need to insist on this strange aberration which led
them to look for the creator of the land and its products, not amid
the cultivators of the soil, but among the idlers.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Such was the
logical conclusion of their argument. We must also remember that
the Physiocrats failed to realise the inherent dignity of all true
labour simply because it was not the creator of wealth. This
applied both to the agricultural labourer and the industrial worker,
and though the former alone was considered productive it was
because he was working in co-operation with nature. It was nature
that produced the wealth and not the worker.</p>

<p>Something must also be attributed to their environment. Knowing
only feudal society, with its economic and political activities governed
and directed by idle proprietors, they suffered from an illusion as
to the necessity for landed property similar to that which led
Aristotle to defend the institution of slavery.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Although they failed to foresee the criticisms that would be
levelled against the institution of private property, they were very
assiduous—especially the Abbé Baudeau—in seeking an explanation
of its origin and a justification of its existence. The reasons which
they advanced are more worthy of quotation than almost any
argument that has since been employed by conservative economists.</p>

<p>The most solid argument, in their opinion—at least the one that
was most frequently used—is that these proprietors are either the
men who cleared and drained the land or else their rightful descendants.
They have incurred or they are incurring expenditure in clearing
the land, enclosing it and building upon it—what the Physiocrats
call the <i>avances foncières</i>.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> They never get their revenues through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
some one else as the manufacturers do, and they are anything but
parasites. Their portion is <i>optimo jure</i>, in virtue of a right prior and
superior even to that of the cultivators, for although the cultivators
help to make the product, the proprietors help to make the land.
The three social classes of the Physiocratic scheme may be likened
to three persons who get their water from the same well. It is
drawn from the well by members of the productive class in bucketfuls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which are passed on to the proprietors, but the latter class
gives nothing in return for it, for the well is of their making. At a
respectable distance comes the sterile class, obliged to buy water in
exchange for its labour.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The Physiocrats failed to notice the contradiction involved in
this. If the revenue which the proprietor draws represents the
remuneration for his outlay and the return for his expenditure it is
no longer a gift of nature, and the net product vanishes, for, by
definition, it represented what was left of the gross product after
paying all initial expenses—the excess over cost of production. If we
accept this explanation of the facts there is no longer any surplus
to dispose of. It is as capitalists pure and simple and not as the
representatives of God that proprietors obtain their rents.</p>

<p>Must we really believe that although these outlays afford some
explanation of the existence of private property they supply no
means of measuring or of limiting its extent? Is there no connection
between these outlays and the revenues which landed proprietors
draw?</p>

<p>Or must we distinguish between the two portions of the revenue—the
one, indispensable, representing the reimbursement of the
original outlay, and in every respect comparable to the revenue of
the farmer, and the other, being a true surplus, constituting the
net product? How can they justify the appropriation of the
latter?</p>

<p>There is another argument held in reserve, namely, that based
upon social utility. They point out that the cultivation of land
would cease and the one source of all wealth would become barren
if the pioneer were not allowed to reap the fruits of his labour.</p>

<p>The new argument is a contradiction of the old. In the former
case land was appropriated because it had been cultivated. In the
present case land must be appropriated before it can be cultivated.
In the former labour is treated as the efficient cause, in the latter
as the final cause of production.</p>

<p>Finally, the Physiocrats believed that landed proprietorship was
simply the direct outcome of “personal property,” or of the right
of every man to provide for his own sustenance. This right includes
the right of personal estate, which in turn involves the right of landed
property. These three kinds of property are so closely connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that in reality they form one unit, and no one of the three can be
detached without involving the destruction of the other two.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
They were full of veneration for property of every description—not
merely for landed property. “The safety of private property
is the real basis of the economic order of society,” says Quesnay.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Mercier de la Rivière writes: “Property may be regarded as a
tree of which social institutions are branches growing out of the
trunk.”<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> We shall encounter this cult of property even during
the terrible days of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror.
When all respect for human life was quite lost there still remained
this respect for property.</p>

<p>The defence of private property was already well-nigh complete.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
But if they were strong in their defence of the institution they did not
fail to impose upon it some onerous duties—which counterbalanced
its eminent dignity. Of course, every proprietor should always be
guided by reason and be mannerly in his behaviour, and he should
never allow mere authority to become the rule of life.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Their duties
are as follows:</p>

<p>1. They must continue without fail to bring lands into cultivation,
<i>i.e.</i> they must continue the <i>avances foncières</i>.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>2. They must dispose of the wealth which the nation has produced
in such a way as to further the general interest; this is their
task as the stewards of society.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>3. They must aim during their leisure at giving to society all
those gratuitous services which they can render, and which society
so sorely needs.</p>

<p>4. They must bear the whole burden of taxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Above all they must protect their tenants, the agriculturists,
and be very careful not to demand more than the net product.
The Physiocrats never go the length of advising them to give to their
tenants a portion of the net product, but they impress upon them the
importance of giving them the equivalent of their annual expenditure
and of dealing liberally with them. It does not seem much, but it
must have been something in those days. “I say it boldly,” writes
Baudeau, “cursed be every proprietor, every sovereign and emperor
that puts all the burden upon the peasant, and the land, which
gives all of us our sustenance. Show them that the lot of the
worthy individuals who employ their own funds or who depend
upon those of others is to none of us a matter of complete indifference,
that whoever hurts or degrades, attacks or robs them is the cruellest
enemy of society, and that he who ennobles them, furthers their
well-being, comfort, or leisure increases their output of wealth,
which after all is the one source of income for every class in society.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Such generous words, which were none too common at the time,
release the Physiocrats from the taunt of showing too great a favour
to the proprietors. In return for such privileges as they gave them
they demanded an amount of social service far beyond anything that
was customary at the time.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>So far we have considered only the Physiocratic theory. But the
Physiocratic influence can be much more clearly traced if we turn to
applied economics and examine their treatment of such questions as
the regulation of industry, the functions of the State, and the problems
of taxation.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h5 id="heading4">I: TRADE</h5>

<p>All exchange, the Physiocrats thought, was unproductive, for
by definition it implies a transfer of equal values. If each party
only receives the exact equivalent of what it gives there is no wealth
produced. It may happen, however, that the parties to the exchange
are of unequal strength, and the one may grow rich at the expense
of the other.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In giving a bottle of wine in exchange for a loaf of
bread there is a double displacement of wealth, which evidently
affords a fuller satisfaction of wants in both cases, but there is no
wealth created, for the objects so exchanged are of equal value.
To-day the reasoning would be quite different. The present-day
economist would argue as follows: “If I exchange my wine for
your bread, that is a proof that my hunger is greater than my
thirst, but that you are more thirsty than hungry. Consequently
the wine has increased in utility in passing from my hands into
yours, and the bread, likewise, in passing from your hands into
mine, and this double increase of utility constitutes a real increase
of wealth.” Such reasoning would have appeared absurd to the
Physiocrats, who conceived of wealth as something material, and
they could never have understood how the creation of a purely
subjective attribute like utility could ever be considered productive.</p>

<p>We have already had occasion to remark that industry and
commerce were considered unproductive. This was a most significant
fact, so far as commerce was concerned, because all the
theories that held the field under Mercantilism, notably the doctrine
that foreign commerce afforded the only possible means of increasing
a country’s wealth, immediately assumed a dwindling importance.
For the Mercantilists the prototype of the State was a rich merchant
of Amsterdam. For the Physiocrats it was John Bull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>And foreign trade, like domestic, produced no real wealth:
the only result was a possible gain, and one man’s gain is another
man’s loss. “Every commercial nation flatters itself upon its
growing wealth as the outcome of foreign trade. This is a truly
astonishing phenomenon, for they all believe that they are growing rich
and gaining from one another. It must be admitted that this gain,
as they call it, is a most remarkable thing, for they all gain and none
loses.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> A country must, of course, obtain from foreigners the
goods which it cannot itself produce in exchange for those it cannot
itself consume. Foreign trade is quite indispensable, but Mercier
de la Rivière thinks that it is a necessary evil<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> (he underlines the
word). Quesnay contents himself with referring to it merely as
a <i>pis aller</i>.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> He thought that the only really useful exchange is one
in which agricultural products pass directly from producers to consumers,
for without this the products would be useless and would
simply perish in the producer’s hands. But that kind of exchange
which consists in buying products in order to resell them—trafficking,
or a commercial transaction, as we call it—is sheer waste, for the
wealth instead of growing larger becomes less, because a portion of
it is absorbed by the traffickers themselves.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> We meet with the
same idea in Carey. Mercier de la Rivière ingeniously compares
such traders to mirrors, arranged in such a way that they reflect
a number of things at the same time, all in different positions.
“Like mirrors, too, the traders seem to multiply commodities, but
they only deceive the superficial.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>That may be; but, admitting a contempt for commerce, what
conclusions do they draw from it? Shall they prohibit it, or regulate
it, or shall they just let it take its own course? Any one of these
conclusions would follow from their premises. If commerce be as
useless as they tried to make out, the first solution would be the
best. But it was the third that they were inclined to adopt, and we
must see why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems quite evident that the Physiocrats would have condemned
both the Mercantile and the Colbertian systems. Both of these
aimed at securing a favourable balance of trade—an aim which
the Physiocrats considered illusory, if not actually immoral. But
if they thought all trade was useless it is not easy to understand their
enthusiasm for Free Trade. Those economists who nowadays favour
Free Trade support it in the belief that it is of immense benefit to
every country wherein it is practised, and that the more it is
developed the richer will the exchanging countries become. But
such was not the Physiocratic doctrine. It is a noteworthy fact that
they are to be regarded as the founders of Free Trade, not because
of any desire to favour trade as such, but because their attitude
towards it was one of disdainful <i>laissez-faire</i>. They were not,
perhaps, altogether free from the belief that <i>laissez-faire</i> would lead
to the disappearance of commerce altogether. They were Free
Traders primarily because they desired the freedom of domestic
trade, and we must not lose sight of those extraordinary regulations
which completely fettered its movements at this time.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The “natural order” also implied that each one would be free to
buy or sell wherever he chose, within or without the country. It
recognised no frontiers,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> for only through “liberty” could the
“good price” be secured. The “good price” meant the highest
price and not the lowest, dearth and not cheapness. “Free
competition with foreign merchants can alone secure the best
possible price, and only the highest price will enable us to increase
our stock of wealth and to maintain our population by agriculture.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
This is the language of agriculturists rather than of Free Traders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
It is the natural result of thinking about agricultural problems,
and especially about the question of raising corn; and since Free
Trade at this time gave rise to no fears on the score of importation,
free exchange meant free exportation. Oncken points out that the
commercial <i>régime</i> which the Physiocrats advocated was identical
with that in operation in England about this time, where in case
of over-abundance exportation was encouraged in order to keep
up the price, and in case of dearth importation was permitted in
order to ensure a steady supply and to prevent the price rising
too much.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In a word, Free Trade meant for the Physiocrats the total abolition
of all those measures which found so much favour with the Mercantilists,
and which aimed at preventing exportation to places outside
the country and checking the growth of free intercourse within
it.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Narrow as their conception of Free Trade at first was, it was not
long in growing out of the straitened circumstances which gave it
birth, and it developed gradually into the Free Trade doctrine as we
know it, which Walras expressed as follows: “Free competition
secures for every one the maximum final utility, or, what comes to
the same thing, gives the maximum satisfaction.” We no longer
admit that international trade is a mere <i>pis aller</i>. But all the arguments
which have been used in its defence on the Free Trade side were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
first formulated by the Physiocrats. We shall refer to a few of
them.</p>

<p>The fallacy lurking behind the “balance of trade” theory is
exposed with great neatness by Mercier de la Rivière. “I will
drown the clamour of all your blind and stupid policies. Suppose
that I gave you all the money which circulates among the nations
with whom you trade. Imagine it all in your possession. What
would you do with it?” He goes on to show how not a single
foreign country will any longer be able to buy, and consequently
all exportation will cease. The result of this excessive dearness
will be that buying from foreign countries will be resorted to, and
this will result in the exportation of metallic currency, which will
soon readjust matters.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The contention that import duties are paid by the foreigner
is also refuted. Nothing will be sold by the foreigner at a lower
price than that which other nations would be willing to give him.
An import duty on such goods will increase the real price, which the
foreigner will demand, and this import duty will be paid by those
who buy the goods.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>There is also a refutation of the policy known as reciprocity.
“A nation levies an import duty upon the goods of another nation,
but it forgets that in trying to injure the selling nation it is really
checking the possible consumption of its own goods. This indirect
effect, of course, is inevitable, but can nothing be done to remedy
this by means of reprisals? England levies a heavy duty on French
wines, thereby reducing its debit account with France very considerably,
but more French wine will not be bought if a tax is also
placed upon the goods which England exports to France. Do
you think that the prejudice which England has taken against
France can be remedied in this way?”</p>

<p>We have multiplied instances, for during the whole of the hundred
years which have since elapsed has anyone deduced better arguments?</p>

<p>These theories immediately received legal sanction in the edicts
of 1763 and 1766 establishing free trade in corn, first within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the country and then without, but some very serious restrictions
were still retained. Unfortunately Nature proved very ungrateful to
her friends. For four or five years she ran riot with a series of bad
harvests, for which, as we may well imagine, the Physiocratic <i>régime</i>
and its inspirers were held responsible. Despite the protests of the
Physiocrats, this liberal act was repealed in 1770. It was re-established
by Turgot in 1774, and again repealed by Necker in 1777—a
variety of fortune that betokens a fickleness of public opinion.</p>

<p>This new piece of legislation, and, indeed, the whole Physiocratic
theory, was subjected to severe criticism by an abbot of the name
of Galiani. Galiani was a Neapolitan monsignor residing at the
French court. At the age of twenty-four he had written a remarkable
work in Italian dealing with money, and in 1770, written in splendid
French, appeared his <i>Dialogues sur le Commerce des Blés</i>. It was
an immediate success, and it won the unqualified approval of
Voltaire, who was possibly attracted more by the style than by the
profundity of thought. Galiani was not exactly opposed to <i>laissez-faire</i>.
“Liberty,” he wrote, “stands in no need of defence so long
as it is at all possible. Whenever we can we ought to be on the side
of liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But he is opposed to general systems and against
complete self-surrender into the hands of Nature. “Nature,”
says he, “is too vast to be concerned about our petty trifles.”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
He shares the realistic or historical views of the writers of to-day,
and thinks that before applying the principles of political economy
some account should be taken of time, place, and circumstances.
“The state of which the Physiocrats speak—what is it? Where
is it to be found.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Along with Galiani we must mention the great financier Necker,
who in a bulky volume entitled <i>La Législation et le Commerce des
Grains</i> (1775) advocates opportunistic views almost identical in
character with those of Galiani, and who, as Minister of State
(1776-81 and 1788-90), put an end to free trade in corn.</p>

<p>In monetary matters, especially on the question of interest, the
Physiocrats were willing to recognize an exception to their principle
of non-intervention. Mirabeau thought that whenever a real increase
of wealth resulted from the use of capital, as in agriculture,
the payment of interest was only just. It was simply a sign or
symbol of the net product. But in trade matters he thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
best to limit if not to prohibit it altogether. It often proved very
harmful, and frequently was nothing better than a tax levied by
order of “the corrosive landowners.” Quesnay could not justify it
except in those cases where it yielded a net product, but he was
content simply to suggest a limitation of it. The Physiocrats are at
least logical. If capital sunk in industrial and commercial undertakings
yields no income it is evident that the interest must be taken
from the borrower’s pocket, and they condemned it just as they
condemned taxing the industrial and commercial classes.</p>

<p>Turgot<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> is the only one of them who frankly justifies taking
interest. The reason that he gives is not the usual Physiocratic
argument, but rather that the owner of capital may either invest it
in the land or undertake some other productive work—capital being
the indispensable basis of all enterprise<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>—and that, consequently, the
capital will never be given to anyone who will offer less than what
might have been made out of it did the owner himself employ it.
This argument implies that every undertaking is essentially a productive
one, and indeed one of the traits which distinguishes Turgot
from the other Physiocrats is the fact that he did not think that
industry and commerce were entirely unproductive.</p>

<h5 id="heading5">II: THE FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE</h5>

<p>Seeing that the Physiocrats believed that human society was pervaded
by the principle of “natural order,” which required no adventitious
aid from any written law, and since Nature’s voice, without any
artificial restraint, was sufficient guide for mankind, it might have been
expected that the trend of Physiocracy would have been toward
the negation of all legislation, of all authority—in a word, toward the
subversion of the State.</p>

<p>It is certain that the Physiocrats wished to reduce legislative
activity to a minimum, and they expressed the belief—which has
often been repeated since by every advocate of <i>laissez-faire</i>—that
the most useful work any legislative body can do is to abolish
useless laws.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> If any new laws are required they ought simply to be
copies of the unwritten laws of Nature. Neither men nor Governments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
can make laws, for they have not the necessary ability. Every
law should be an expression of that Divine wisdom which rules
the universe. Hence the true title of lawgiver, not law-maker.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
It is in this connexion that we meet with those anecdotes—some
of more than doubtful authenticity it is true—that have
gathered round their names. Of these the best known is that which
tells of Mercier de la Rivière’s visit to St. Petersburg, and his
laconic reply to Catherine the Great. He had been invited there
to advise the Empress about a new constitution for the country.
After dilating upon the great difficulties of the undertaking and the
responsibilities it involved, he gave it as his opinion that the best way
of achieving her object was just to let things take their course.
Whereupon the Empress promptly wished him good-bye.</p>

<p>But it would be a great mistake to think of the Physiocrats as
anarchists. What they wanted to see was the minimum of legislation
with a maximum of authority. The two things are by no means incompatible.
The liberal policy of limitation and control would have
found scant favour with them. Their ideal was neither democratic
self-government, as we have it in the Greek republics, nor a parliamentary
<i>régime</i> such as we find in England. Both were detested.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, great respect was shown for the social hierarchy,
and they were strong in their condemnation of every doctrine that
aimed at attacking either the throne or the nobility. What they
desired was to have sovereign authority in the guise of a hereditary
monarchy. In short, what they really wanted—and they were not
frightened by the name—was despotism.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>“The sovereign authority should be one, and supreme above
all individual or private enterprise. The object of sovereignty
is to secure obedience, to defend every just right, on the one
hand, and to secure personal security on the other. A government
that is based upon the idea of a balance of power is useless.”<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>This should help us to realise the distance separating the Physiocrats
from the Montesquieuian idea of the distribution of the sovereign
authority, and from the other idea of local or regional control.
There is no mention of representation as a corollary of taxation.
This form of guarantee, which marks the beginnings of parliamentary
government, could have no real significance for the Physiocrats.
Taxation was just a right inherent in the conception of proprietary
sovereignty, a territorial revenue, which was in no way dependent
upon the people’s will.</p>

<p>It seems strange that such should be the opinion of a future
President of the Constituent Assembly. How can we explain this
apparent contradiction and such love of despotism among the
apostles of <i>laissez-faire</i>?</p>

<p>Despotism, in the eyes of the Physiocrats, had a peculiar significance
of its own. It was the work of freedom, not of bondage. It
did not signify the rule of the benevolent despot, prepared to make
men happy, even against their own will. It was just the sovereignty
of the “natural order”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>—nothing more. Every reasonable person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
felt himself bound to obey it, and realised that only through such
obedience could the truth be possibly known.</p>

<p>It is quite different from the despotism of the ancient maxim,
<i>Sicut principi placuit legis habet vigorem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> They would never have
subscribed to the doctrine that the king’s word is law, but they
were equally energetic in rejecting the claim of the popular will.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
They are as far from modern democracy as they are from monarchical
absolutism.</p>

<p>This despotism was incarnate in the person of the sovereign or
king. But he is simply an organ for the transmission of those
higher laws which are given to him. They would compare him
with the leader of an orchestra, his sceptre being the baton that keeps
time. The conductor’s despotism is greater than the Tsar’s, for
every musician has to obey the movement of the hand, and that
immediately. But this is not tyranny, and whoever strikes a false
note in a spirit of revenge is not simply a revolter, but also an
idiot.</p>

<p>Sovereignty appealed to the Physiocrats in the guise of hereditary
monarchy, because of its associations with property under the
feudal <i>régime</i>, and since hereditary rights were connected with landed
property so must royalty be. The sovereign who best represents
the Physiocratic ideal is perhaps the Emperor of China.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> As the
Son of Heaven he represents the “natural order,” which is also the
“divine order.” As an agricultural monarch he solemnly puts his
hand to the plough once a year. His people really govern themselves;
that is, he rules them according to custom and the practice
of sacred rites.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>In practice there will be nothing of great importance for the
despot to do. “As kings and governors you will find how easy it is
to exercise your sacred functions, which simply consist in not
interfering with the good that is already being done, and in punishing
those few persons who occasionally attack private property.”<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
In short, the preservation of the “natural order” and the defending
of its basis—private property—against the attacks of the ignorant
and the sacrilegious is the first and most important duty of the
sovereign. “No order of any kind is possible in society unless the
right of possession is guaranteed to the members of that society
by the force of a sovereign authority.”<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Instruction is the second duty upon which the Physiocrats lay
special stress. “Universal education,” says Baudeau, “is the first
and only social tie.” Quesnay is specially anxious for instruction on
the “natural order,” and the means of becoming acquainted with it.
Further, the only guarantee against personal despotism lies in well-diffused
instruction and an educated public opinion. If public
opinion, as Quesnay said, is to lead, it should be enlightened.</p>

<p>Public works are also mentioned. A wise landlord has good
roads on his property, for good roads and canals improve it. These
represent a species of <i>avances foncières</i>, similar to those undertaken
by proprietors.</p>

<p>This is by no means all.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> There are a number of duties recognised
as belonging to the State, of which every economist of the Liberal
school up to Bastiat and M. de Molinari approves.</p>

<p>We will add one other trait. Like the Liberal school, the Physiocrats
were whole-hearted “internationalists.” In this respect they
differ from their prototypes, the Chinese. They believed that all
class distinctions and all international barriers ought to be removed
in the interest of political development, as well as in that of scientific
study.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The peace advocates of to-day would do well to make the
acquaintance of their illustrious predecessors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h5 id="heading6">III: TAXATION</h5>

<p>The bulk of the Physiocratic system is taken up with the exposition
of a theory of taxation, which really forms one of the most characteristic
portions of their work. Though inextricably bound up with
the theory of the net product and with the conception of landed
proprietorship, curiously enough, it has survived the rest of their
doctrine, and quite recently has been given a new lease of life.</p>

<p>In the table showing the distribution of the national income three
participators only are mentioned—the landed proprietor, the farmer,
and the artisan. But there is also a fourth—the Physiocratic
sovereign, who is none other than the State itself, and who thoroughly
deserves a share. This benevolent despot, whose duties we have
just mentioned, cannot be very exacting, for, having little to do, his
demands must be moderate. In addition to his double mission of
maintaining security and giving instruction, he must also contribute
towards increasing the productivity of the land by establishing public
works, making roads, etc.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Money is required for all this, and the
Physiocrats argued that taxes ought to be paid liberally,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and not
grudgingly, as is too often the case under a parliamentary <i>régime</i>.
Where is this money to come from?</p>

<p>The reply is obvious if we have grasped their system. The only
available fund is the net product, which is the only new wealth
that is really dispensable—the rest is necessarily absorbed in the
repayment of the advances made for the upkeep of the agricultural
and industrial classes. Were taxation to absorb a proportion of the
revenues that are devoted to production it would gradually drain
away the source of all wealth. So long as it only takes the surplus—the
true net product, which is a mere tributary of the main stream—no
harm will be done to future production.</p>

<p>All this is quite clear. But if taxation is to absorb the net<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
product the question arises as to who is to pay it. It is equally
evident that it can only be taken from those who already possess it,
namely, from the landed proprietors, who must bear the whole
burden of taxation. Just now we were amazed at the privileges which
the Physiocrats so light-heartedly granted them: this is the ransom,
and it is no light one. The next problem is how to assess this tax.</p>

<p>The Physiocrats were extremely loth to rob the gentry of their
incomes, and a number of pages in their writings are devoted to a
justification of their claims upon them. Not only were they willing to
leave them everything that was necessary to compensate them for the
outlay of capital and labour, but also all that might be required to
make the property thoroughly valuable and the position of the landowner
a most enviable one.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The preference shown for the landowner
is just the result of the social importance attributed to him by the
Physiocrats. “If some other class were preferable,” says Dupont de
Nemours, “people would turn their attention to that.” They
would no longer spend their capital in clearing or improving the
land. But if the possession of land be so desirable, is there not some
danger lest everybody should become a landlord and neglect the
other walks of life? The Physiocrats thought not, for, since Nature
has set a limit to the amount of land in existence, there must also
be a limit to the number of landowners.</p>

<p>A third of the net product, or, if we accept Baudeau’s figures,
six-twentieths, <i>i.e.</i> 30 per cent., was to be paid in taxes. Taking the
net product at 2 milliard francs, which is the figure given in the
<i>Explication du Tableau économique</i>, this gives us exactly 600 million
francs as the amount of the tax.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The proprietors, who were then for the most part free from
taxation, felt that this was a very considerable contribution, and that
the Physiocrats demanded a heavy price for the high honour which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
they had conferred upon them. Even to-day a tax of 30 per cent.
on the gross revenue of landlords would cause some consternation.
The Physiocrats anticipated this objection, and in reply brought
forward an argument which shows that they possessed exceptionally
keen economic insight. They argued that none would feel the
burden, seeing that no one was really paying it. Land would now be
bought at 70 per cent. of its former value, so that the 30 per cent.
nominally paid by the proprietor was in reality not paid by him
at all.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Land let at £10,000 would be valued at £200,000. But
with a tax of £3000 it is really only yielding £7000, and its value will
be £140,000. The buyer who pays this price, despite the fact that
he has paid a tax of £3000, will enjoy all the revenue to which he has
any claim, for he can only lay claim to what he has paid for, and he
did not pay for that portion of the revenue which is affected by the
tax. It is exactly as if he had only bought seven-tenths of the
land, the remaining three-tenths being the State’s. And if at some
later time this tax should be abolished, it would merely mean
making him a present of £3000 a year—the equivalent of a lump
sum of £60,000.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The reasoning was excellent for those buying land after the tax
had been levied. It had, however, a much wider import than the
Physiocrats thought, for it might be applied not merely to taxes
on land, but also to taxes on capital. But this gave little consolation
to those who were to have the honour of inaugurating the new
<i>régime</i>, and the first task evidently was to convert them.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The sovereign’s position in the main is like that of the landed
proprietors, which is in agreement with the Physiocratic conception
of sovereignty. The landed proprietors and the king in reality
form one class of fellow landowners, with the same rights, the same
duties, and the same revenues. Hence the sovereign’s interests
are completely bound up with those of his country.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The Physiocrats attached the greatest practical importance to
their fiscal system, and were thoroughly convinced that the misery of
the people was due to the unequal distribution of the burden of taxation.
They thought that this was the true source of injustice—in
short, that this was the social problem. To-day we ascribe misery to
unequal distribution of wealth rather than to any particular fiscal
system, and consequently the Physiocratic view seems to us somewhat
extreme. Still, it was perhaps not so difficult to justify, in view of
the frightful conditions of fiscal organisation under the old <i>régime</i>.</p>

<p>The objections which a single tax, levied only on the landed
interest, was bound to provoke were not unforeseen by the Physiocrats,
nor did they neglect to answer them.</p>

<p>To the objection that it was unjust to place the burden of taxation
upon the shoulders of a single class of the nation,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> instead of distributing
it equally among all classes, the Physiocrats replied that
the statesman’s ideal was not equal taxation, but the complete
abolition of all taxation. This could only be achieved by taxing
the “net product.”</p>

<p>Suppose that we agree that the taxes should be paid by some
other class. The question then is to determine what class of the
community should be chosen.</p>

<p>Shall we say that the farmer must pay them? But after deducting
the “net product” what remains for the farmer is just the bare
equivalent of his original outlay. Consequently, if we take 600
millions from the farmers by way of taxation there will be so much
less capital for the land, resulting in a smaller gross product the
following year,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> unless they agitate for a reduction of 600 millions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
their rents. If they succeed this will leave the proprietors in the
position of having paid over the 600 millions to the State. But
we must also reckon the losses and friction incurred in every deviation
from the “natural order.” Suppose we decide that the sterile
classes should pay the taxes. This class is <i>ex hypothesi</i> sterile—that
is, it produces the exact equivalent of what it consumes. To
take 600 millions from this class is tantamount to a reduction of
its consumption by 600 millions, or an equivalent limitation of its
purchases of raw material. The result would be a diminished
product in the future, unless the industrial classes succeeded in
increasing prices by an equivalent amount. Even in that case the
landed proprietors will have to bear the brunt of it: firstly, they
will have to reduce their own consumption, and secondly, their
tenants’, whose efficiency will thereby be impaired.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>This process of reasoning seems to imply that the revenues of
the agricultural and industrial classes are not squeezable because
they represent the indispensable minimum necessary for the
expenses of production. This seems to be an anticipation of the
notorious “iron law.” Turgot’s formula incisively stating this law,
but containing no attempt at a justification, is known to most people.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Long before his day, however, it had been stated by Quesnay in
terms no less pronounced, though perhaps not so well known. “It
is useless to urge that wage-earners can pay the tax so levied upon
them, by restricting consumption and depriving themselves of
luxuries without thereby causing the burden to fall upon the classes
who pay the wages. The rate of wages, and consequently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
amount of comfort and luxury which wages can purchase, are fixed
at the irreducible minimum by the action of the competition which
prevails among them.” This is quite a characteristic trait.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The
author of the “natural order,” without any hesitation, admits that
the direct outcome of the establishment of that order would be to
reduce the life of the wage-earners to a level of bare subsistence.</p>

<p>It is also remarkable that in their study of the industrial classes
wages should have claimed the exclusive attention of the Physiocrats.
Profits even then were by no means unsqueezable, but curiously
enough they failed to realise this. Voltaire’s rich banker would
have proved embarrassing here. They would have had some
difficulty in showing how a reduction of his extravagance could
possibly have endangered production. But they might have replied
that since he had so little difficulty in squeezing the 400,000 <i>livres</i>
out of his fellow-citizens he would not experience much more trouble
in getting another 400,000 out of them and paying them over to the
State.</p>

<p>Another objection consists in the insufficiency of a single tax
to meet all the needs of the State. “In some States it is said that a
third, a half, or even three-fourths of the clear net revenue from
all sources of production is insufficient to meet the demands of the
Treasury, and consequently other forms of taxation are necessary.”<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>In reply to this the Physiocrats would point out that the mere
application of their fiscal system would result in such an increase
in the net product that the yield from the tax would progressively
grow. We must also take account of the economies resulting from
the simplicity of the tax, and the almost complete absence of
expenses of collection. But the most interesting point of all is that
they thought the State should adapt its needs to meet its revenue,
and not <i>vice versa</i>. The great advantage of the Physiocratic <i>impôt</i>,
however, was that it was regulated by a natural norm, which gave
the amount of the net product. Without this, taxation becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
arbitrary.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> At bottom the system affords a barrier against the
autocracy of the sovereign—a barrier that is much more effective
than a parliamentary vote.</p>

<p>One of the disciples of Quesnay put the theory to the test of
practice. The Margrave of Baden had the advantage of being
a prince, and he proceeded to experiment on his own subjects. The
system was tried in three communes of his principality, but, like most
social experiments, failed. In two of the communes it was abandoned
at the end of four years. In a third, despite its evil effects, it was
prolonged until 1802. The increase in the land tax caused a veritable
slump in the value of property just when the remission of taxes upon
consumption was resulting in the rapid multiplication of wineshops
and beerhouses.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> It is unnecessary to add that the failure of the
experiment did nothing to weaken the faith of the Margrave or his
fellow Physiocrats. An experiment on so small a scale could not
possibly be accepted as decisive. This is the usual retort of innovators
when social experiments prove failures, but we must recognise
the element of truth contained in their reply.</p>

<p>But if we wish to see the real results of the Physiocratic system
we must look beyond the private experiments of a prince. Elsewhere
the effects were much more far-reaching.</p>

<p>The fiscal aspect of the French Revolution owed its guiding
inspiration to their ideas. Out of a budget of 500 million francs the
Constituent Assembly decreed that about half of it—that is, 240
millions—should be got out of a tax levied upon land, equal to a tax
of 2400 million francs nowadays; and the greatest part of it was
to be raised by direct taxation.</p>

<p>Distrust of indirect taxation, and of all taxes on commodities,
is also a consequence of the Physiocratic system—a distrust that is
bound to grow as society becomes more democratic. Most of the
arguments in favour of direct taxation are to be found in the Physiocratic
writings. But the chief one employed nowadays—namely,
that indirect taxes often bear no proportion to the amount of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
revenue, but weigh heaviest upon those who have least, is not among
them. This concern about proportionality, which is merely another
word for justice, was quite foreign to their thoughts.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>At a later stage of this work it will be our duty to call attention
to the enthusiasm aroused by this old theory of an <i>impôt unique</i> as
advocated in the works of an eminent American economist,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> who
renders homage to the Physiocrats for inspiring him with ideals
altogether opposed to those of the landed proprietors. And a similar
movement under the very same name—the single-tax system—is
still vigorous in the United States.</p>

<h5 id="heading7">IV: <i>RÉSUMÉ</i> OF THE PHYSIOCRATIC DOCTRINE.
CRITICS AND DISSENTERS</h5>

<p>A brief <i>résumé</i> of the contributions made to economic science by
the Physiocrats will help us to realise their great importance.</p>

<p>From the theoretical point of view we have:</p>

<p>1. The idea that every social phenomenon is subject to law,
and that the object of scientific study is to discover such laws.</p>

<p>2. The idea that personal interest if left to itself will discover
what is most advantageous for it, and that what is best for the
individual is also best for everybody. But this liberal doctrine
had many advocates before the Physiocrats.</p>

<p>3. The conception of free competition, resulting in the establishment
of the <i>bon prix</i>, which is the most advantageous price for
both parties, and implies the extinction of all usurious profit.</p>

<p>4. An imperfect but yet searching analysis of production, and
of the various divisions of capital. An excellent classification of
incomes and of the laws of their distribution.</p>

<p>5. A collection of arguments which have long since become
classic in favour of landed property.</p>

<p>From a practical point of view we have:</p>

<p>1. The freedom of labour.</p>

<p>2. Free trade within a country, and an impassionate appeal for
the freedom of foreign trade.</p>

<p>3. Limitation of the functions of the State.</p>

<p>4. A first-class demonstration of the superiority of direct taxation
over indirect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>It is unjust to reproach the Physiocrats, as is sometimes done,
with giving us nothing but social metaphysics. A little over-systemisation
may prove useful in the early stages of a science. Its
very faults have some usefulness. We must admit, however, that
although their conception of the “natural order” supplied the
foundation, or at least the scaffolding, for political economy, it became
so intertwined with a kind of optimism that it nullified the
work of the Liberal school, especially in France.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>But the greatest gap in the Physiocratic doctrine is the total
absence of any reference to value, and their grossly material, almost
terrestrial, conception of production. They seldom mention value,
and what little they do say is often confused and commonplace.
Herein lies the source of their mistakes concerning the unproductive
character of exchange and industry, which are all the more remarkable
in view of the able discussions of this very question by a number
of their contemporaries. Among these may be mentioned Cantillon,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
who resembles them in some respects and whose essay on commerce
was published in 1755; the Abbé Galiani, who dealt with the
question in his <i>Della Moneta</i> (1750); and the Abbé Morellet, who discussed
the same topic in his <i>Prospectus d’un Nouveau Dictionnaire du
Commerce</i> (1769). More important than any of them, perhaps, is
Condillac, whose work <i>Du Commerce et du Gouvernement</i> was unfortunately
not published until 1776; but by that time the Physiocratic
system had been completed, and their pre-eminence well established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Turgot, though one of their number, is an exception. He was
never a thoroughgoing Physiocrat, and his ideas concerning value
are much more scientific.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> He defines it as “an expression of the
varying esteem which man attaches to the different objects of his
desire.” This definition gives prominence to the subjective character
of value, and the phrases “varying esteem” and “desire” give it
greater precision.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It is true that he also added that besides this
relative attribute value always implied “some real intrinsic quality
of the object.” He has frequently been reproached for this, but all
that he meant to say was that our desire always implies a certain correctness
of judgment, which is indisputable unless every judgment
is entirely illusory. But Turgot would never have admitted that.</p>

<p>It is possible that Turgot inspired Condillac, and that he himself
owed his inspiration to Galiani, whose book, which appeared twenty
years earlier, he frequently quotes. This work contains a very
acute psychological analysis of value, showing how it depends upon
scarcity on the one hand and utility on the other.</p>

<p>Besides a difference in his general standpoint, there are other
considerations which distinguish Turgot from the members of the
Physiocratic school, and it would have been juster to him as well as
more correct to have devoted a whole chapter to him.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Generally
speaking, his views are much more modern and more closely akin to
Smith’s. In view of the exigencies of space we must be content to
draw attention to the principal doctrines upon which he differs from
the Physiocrats.</p>

<p>1. The fundamental opposition between the productivity of
agriculture and the sterility of industry, if not altogether abandoned,
is at least reduced in importance.</p>

<p>2. Landed property is no longer an institution of divine origin.
Even the appeal to the “ground expenses” is dropped. As an institution
it rests merely upon the fact of occupation and public utility.</p>

<p>3. Movable property, on the other hand, holds a prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
place. The function of capital is more carefully analysed and the
legitimacy of interest definitely proved.</p>

<p>But we must turn to Condillac’s book if we want to see how the
Physiocratic doctrine should be completed and expurgated of its
errors. Condillac was already well known as a philosopher when,
in his sixtieth year, he published this new work in 1776. This
admirable book, entitled <i>Le Commerce et le Gouvernement considérés
relativement l’un à l’autre</i>, contains an outline of most modern problems.
The title gives no adequate indication of the character of the work,
and possibly accounts for the oblivion into which the book has fallen.</p>

<p>It is a genuine economic treatise, and not a medley of economic
and political suggestions concerning social science, with an admixture
of ethics and jurisprudence. Value is regarded as the foundation
of the science, and the Physiocrats are thus out-classed from the
very first.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Value itself is considered to be based upon utility, which
is stripped of its popular meaning, and given a scientific connotation
which it has never lost. It no longer implies an intrinsic, physical
property of matter, but connotes a degree of correspondence between
a commodity and a given human want. “Value is not an attribute
of matter, but represents our sense of its usefulness, and this utility
is relative to our need. It grows or diminishes according as our
need expands or contracts.” This is the foundation of the psychological
theory of value.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>But this is not all—though a great deal. He clearly realises that
utility is not the only determinant of value; that quantity, <i>i.e.</i> scarcity
or abundance, also exercises an important influence. With admirable
judgment he seizes upon the connection between them, and shows
how the two statements are united in one, for quantity only influences
value according as its action upon utility intensifies or weakens demand.
“But since the value of things is based upon need it is natural
that a more keenly felt need should endow things with greater value,
while a less urgent need endows them with less. Value increases
with scarcity and diminishes with plenty. In case of plenty it may
even disappear; a superabundant good will be valueless if one
has no use for it.”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This could not be put more clearly to-day.
Here we have the germ of the theories of Jevons and the Austrian
school, though it took a long time to develop.</p>

<p>We might naturally expect a superior treatment of exchange
following upon this new theory of value. If value is simply the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
satisfaction of want, exchange creates two values when it satisfies
two needs at the same time. The characteristic of exchange is that
each of the two parties yields what it has in superabundance in return
for what it needs. But what is given up is superabundant, is useless,
and consequently valueless; what is demanded has greater utility,
and consequently greater value. Two men come to market each
with a useless thing, and each returns with a useful one.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Consequently
the Physiocratic saying that exchange means no gain to
anyone, or at least that the gain of one only compensates for the
loss of the others, is seen to be radically false. The Physiocrats—notably
Trosne—attempted a reply, but, for reasons already given,
they never succeeded in realising the subjective character of value.</p>

<p>This same theory should have carried Condillac a stage further,
and helped in the rectification of the Physiocratic error concerning
production. If value is simply utility and utility itself is just the
correspondence between things and our demand for them, what is
the agency that produces this harmony between things and desires?
It is very seldom that nature succeeds in establishing it. “Nature
is frequently fertile in things we have no desire for and lavish of
what is useless”—a profound remark that ought to have cooled
the Physiocrats’ love of the <i>Alma Parens</i>. “Matter is transformed
and made useful by dint of human labour. Production means giving
new form to matter.”<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> If this be true, then there is no difference
between agricultural and industrial production, for they both transform
what already exists.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the theory proves very clearly that if artisans and proprietors
are dependent upon the agriculturists—as, indeed, they are—the
latter in their turn are nothing but artisans. “If someone asks
whether agriculture ought to be preferred to manufacture or manufacture
to agriculture, we must reply that we have no preferences, and
that the best use should be made of both.”<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, his definition of wages, short as it is, is of immense
significance. “Wages represent the share of the product which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
due to the workers as co-partners.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Wages only “represent” the
share that is due to the workers. In other words, the wage-earner,
either through want of will or of power, cannot exercise his rightful
claim to his own work, and simply surrenders the claim in return for
a money price. This constitutes his salary, which is regulated, like
every other price, by competition between buyers and sellers.
Condillac makes no reference to an iron law of wages, but regards
them as determined by the forces of demand and supply. He does,
however, hint at the implicit alliance which exists between capital
and labour.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>From a practical standpoint also, especially in his defence of free
labour and his condemnation of corporations, Condillac is more
categorical than the Physiocrats. “All these iniquitous privileges,”
he writes, “have no claim to a place in the order beyond the fact
that they are already established.” He is as persistent as Turgot
in his justification of the taking of interest and in his demand for
the determination of the rate by competition. This very elegant
argument is employed to show its similarity to exchange: Exchange
implies compensation for overcoming the drawbacks of distance,
whether of place or of time.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Exchange generally refers to place,
interest to time, and this is really the foundation of the modern theory.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II_ADAM_SMITH">CHAPTER II: ADAM SMITH</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the originality and vigour displayed by the
Physiocrats, they can only be regarded as the heralds of the new
science. Adam Smith,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> it is now unanimously agreed, is its true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
founder. The appearance of his great work on the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>
in 1776 instantly eclipsed the tentative efforts of his predecessors.
To-day the Physiocratic doctrines scarcely do more than arouse
historical curiosity, while Smith’s work has been the guide for
successive generations of economists and the starting-point of all
their speculation. Even at the present day, despite many changes
in the fundamental principles of the science, no economist can afford
to neglect the old Scotch author without unduly narrowing his
scientific horizon.</p>

<p>Several reasons account for the commanding position held by
this book—a position which no subsequent treatise has ever successfully
rivalled.</p>

<p>First is its supreme literary charm. It is above all an interesting
book, bristling with facts and palpitating with life. The burning
questions of the hour, such as the problems presented by the colonial
<i>régime</i>, the trading companies, the mercantile system, the monetary
question, and taxation, supply the author with congenial themes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
his treatment. His discussion of these questions is marked by such
mastery of detail and such balance of judgment that he convinces
without effort. His facts are intermixed with reasoning, his illustrations
with argument. He is instructive as well as persuasive. Withal
there is no trace of pedantry, no monotonous reiteration in the work,
and the reader is not burdened with the presence of a cumbersome
logical apparatus. All is elegantly simple. Neither is there the
slightest suggestion of the cynic. Rather a passion of genuinely
human sympathy, occasionally bordering upon eloquence, breathes
through the pages. Thanks to rare qualities such as these we can
still feel something of the original freshness of this old book.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Smith has been successful in borrowing from
his predecessors all their more important ideas and welding them
into a more general system. He superseded them because he
rendered their work useless. A true social and economic philosophy
was substituted for their fragmentary studies, and an entirely new
value given to their contributions. Taken out of their isolation, they
help to illustrate his general theory, becoming themselves illuminated
in the process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Like most great writers, Smith knows how to borrow without
impairing his originality. Over a hundred authors are quoted in
his book, but he does not always acknowledge them. The names of
some of the writers who exercised such influence over him, and
opened up the path which he afterwards followed, deserve more
than a passing reference.</p>

<p>The first place among these belongs, perhaps, to Hutcheson,
Smith’s predecessor in the chair of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow.
The divisions of the subject are almost identical with those given by
Hutcheson, and many of Smith’s best known theories can be traced
in the <i>System of Moral Philosophy</i> published by Hutcheson in
1755, but which we know was written long before. Hutcheson laid
great stress upon the supreme importance of division of labour, and
his views on such questions as the origin and variations in the value
of money and the possibility of corn or labour affording a more
stable standard of value closely resemble those of the <i>Wealth of
Nations</i>.</p>

<p>David Hume is a near second. Smith refers to him as “by far
the most illustrious philosopher and historian of the present age,”<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
and from 1752 onward they were the closest of friends. Hume was
already the author of some essays on economic questions, the most
important among them dealing with money, foreign trade, the rate
of interest, etc. These, along with several other writings, were published
in the <i>Political Discourses</i> in 1752. Hume’s examination of
these problems displays his original penetrative thought, and there
is evident the profundity and lucidity of treatment characteristic
of all his writings. The absurdity of the Mercantile policy and
of interfering with the natural tendency of money to adapt itself
to the needs of each community, the sophistry of the balance of
trade theory, and the impious consequences resulting from commercial
jealousy among nations are exposed with admirable force
in these essays. No doubt the essays left a great impression upon
Smith. He quoted them in his lectures at Glasgow, and Hume
consulted him before bringing out a second edition. It is true that
Smith eventually became the stauncher Liberal of the two. Hume,
in his essay on the <i>Balance of Trade</i>, recognized the legitimacy of
certain protective rights which Smith wished removed altogether.
Still it was to Hume that Smith owed his conversion to the Liberal
faith.</p>

<p>On this matter of commercial liberty there was already, towards
the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
centuries, a small but a growing band of Mercantilists who had
begun to protest against the irksomeness of the Customs regulations.
They were, of course, still largely imbued with mercantile prejudice,
but they are rightly classed as “Liberals.” Just as in France
Boisguillebert had foreshadowed the Physiocrats, so in England
Child, Petty, Tucker, Dudley North, and Gregory King had been
preparing the way for a more liberal policy in foreign trade.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>In addition to Hutcheson and Hume one other writer must be
mentioned in this connection, namely, Bernard de Mandeville. He
was not an economist at all, but a doctor with considerable philosophical
interests. In 1704 he had published a small poem, which,
along with a number of additions, was republished in 1714 under the
title of <i>The Fable of the Bees; or, Private Vices Public Benefits</i>. The
fundamental idea of the book, which caused quite a sensation at the
time, and which was seized by order of the Government, is that
civilisation—understanding by that term not only wealth, but also
the arts and sciences—is the outcome, not of the virtues of mankind,
but of what Mandeville calls its vices; in other words, that the
desire for well-being, comfort, luxury, and all the pleasures of life
arises from our natural wants. The book was a sort of apology
for the natural man and a criticism of the virtuous.</p>

<p>Smith criticised Mandeville in his <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
and reproached him particularly for referring to tastes and desires as
vices though in themselves they were nowise blameworthy. But
despite his criticism Mandeville’s idea bore fruit in Smith’s mind.
Smith in his turn was to reiterate the belief that it was personal
interest (in his opinion no vice, but an inferior virtue) that unwittingly
led society in the paths of well-being and prosperity. A nation’s
wealth for Smith as well as for Mandeville is the result, if not of a
vice, at least of a natural instinct which is not itself virtuous, but
which is bestowed upon us by Providence for the realisation of
ends that lie beyond our farthest ken.</p>

<p>Such are the principal writers in whose works we may find an
outline of some of the more important ideas which Smith was to
incorporate in a true system.</p>

<p>Mere systematisation, however, would not have given the <i>Wealth
of Nations</i> its unique position. Prior to Smith’s time attempts had
been made by Quesnay and the Physiocrats to outline the scope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the science and to link its various portions together by means of a
few general principles. Although he was not the first to produce a
connected scientific treatise out of this material, he had a much
greater measure of success than any of his predecessors.</p>

<p>Smith owed much to the Physiocrats, but he had little personal
acquaintance with them beyond that afforded by his brief stay in
Paris in 1765. Slight as the intimacy was, however, there is no
doubt about the influence they had upon him. It is also very improbable
that he had read all their works: Turgot’s <i>Réflexions</i>, for
example, written in 1766, but only published in 1769-70, was probably
not known to him. But frequent personal converse with both
Turgot and Quesnay had helped him in acquiring precise first-hand
knowledge of their views. We can easily guess which ideas would
attract him most.</p>

<p>On one point at least he had no need to be enlightened, for in the
matter of economic liberalism he had long been known as a doughty
champion. But the ardent faith of the Physiocrats must have
strengthened his own belief very considerably.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it appears that he borrowed from the Physiocrats
the important idea concerning the distribution of the annual
revenue between the various classes in the nation. In his lectures
at Glasgow he scarcely mentions anything except production, but
in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> an important place is given to distribution.
The difference can hardly be explained except upon the hypothesis
of Smith’s growing acquaintance with the <i>Tableau économique</i> and
the theory of the “net product.”</p>

<p>But admitting that he borrowed what was most characteristic
and most suggestive in their teaching, his treatment of its many
complicated aspects is altogether superior to theirs. The Physiocrats
were so impressed by the importance of agriculture that they utterly
failed to see the problem in its true perspective. They scanned the
field through a crevice, and their vision was consequently narrow
and limited. Smith, on the other hand, took the whole field of
economic activity as his province, and surveyed the ground from an
eminence where the view was clearest and most extensive.</p>

<p>The economic world he regarded as a vast workshop created by
division of labour, one universal psychological principle—the desire
of everyone to better his lot—supplying unity to its diverse phenomena.
Political economy was at last to be based, not on the interests
of a particular class, whether manufacturing or agricultural, but
upon a consideration of the general interest of the whole community.
Such are the directing principles that inspire the whole work, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
guiding lines amidst what had hitherto seemed a mere chaos
of economic facts. Contemporaries never counted upon the difficulties
which the new science was bound to encounter, so great was
their enthusiasm at having a fixed standpoint from which for the
first time the complex interests of agriculture, industry, and commerce
might be impartially surveyed. With Smith the study
emerged from the “system” stage and became a science.</p>

<p>Our examination of Smith’s views will be grouped around three
points:</p>

<p>(I) Division of labour.</p>

<p>(II) The “natural” organisation of the economic world under
the influence of personal interest.</p>

<p>(III) Liberalism.</p>

<h4 id="heading8">I: DIVISION OF LABOUR</h4>

<p>It was Quesnay who had propounded the theory that agriculture
was the source of all wealth, both the State’s and the individual’s.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Adam Smith seized upon the phrase and sought to disprove it in his
opening sentence by giving to wealth its true origin in the general
activity of society. “The annual labour of every nation is the fund
which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences
of life which it annually consumes, and which consist always either
in the immediate produce of that labour or in what is purchased with
that produce from other nations.”</p>

<p>Labour is the true source of wealth. When Smith propounded
this celebrated theory, which has given rise to so many misunderstandings
since, it was not intended that it should minimise the
importance of natural forces or depreciate the part which capital
plays in production.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> No one, except perhaps J. B. Say, has been
more persistent in emphasising the importance of capital, and to the
land, as we shall presently see, he attributed a special degree of productivity.
But from the very outset Smith was anxious to emphasise
the distinction between his doctrine and that of the Physiocrats.
So he definitely affirms that it is human activity and not natural
forces which produces the mass of commodities consumed every year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Without the former’s directing energy the latter would for ever
remain useless and fruitless.</p>

<p>He is not slow to draw inferences from this doctrine. Work,
employed in the widest sense, and not nature, is the parent of wealth—not
the work of a single class like the agriculturists, but the work
of all classes. Hence all work has a claim to be regarded as productive.
The nation’s annual income owes something to everyone who
toils. It is the result of their collaboration, of their “co-operation”
as he calls it. There is no longer any need for the distinction between
the sterile and the productive classes, for only the idle are sterile.</p>

<p>A nation is just a vast workshop, where the labour of each,
however diverse in character, adds to the wealth of all. The passage
in which Adam Smith expresses this idea is well known, but no
apology is needed for quoting it once again.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> “What a variety of
labour too is necessary in order to produce the tools of the meanest
of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated machines
as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of
the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labour is requisite
in order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which
the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace
for smelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the
charcoal to be made use of in the smelting-house, the brick-maker,
the brick-layer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the mill-wright,
the forger, the smith, must all of them join their different arts in
order to produce them. Were we to examine, in the same manner,
all the different parts of his dress and household furniture, the
coarse linen shirt which he wears next his skin, the shoes which
cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all the different parts
which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he prepares his victuals,
the coals which he makes use of for that purpose, dug from the bowels
of the earth, and brought to him perhaps by a long sea and a long
land carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all the furniture
of his table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter plates upon
which he serves up and divides his victuals, the different hands
employed in preparing his bread and his beer, the glass window
which lets in the heat and the light, and keeps out the wind and the
rain, with all the knowledge and art requisite for preparing that
beautiful and happy invention, without which these northern parts
of the world could scarce have afforded a very comfortable habitation,
together with the tools of all the different workmen employed
in producing those different conveniencies; if we examine, I say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
all these things, and consider what a variety of labour is employed
about each of them, we shall be sensible that without the assistance
and co-operation of many thousands, the very meanest person in a
civilized country could not be provided, even according to, what we
very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in which he is
commonly accommodated.”</p>

<p>Division of labour is simply the spontaneous realisation of a
particular form of this social co-operation. Smith’s peculiar merit
lies in placing this fact in its true position as the basis of his whole
work. The book opens upon this note, whose economic and social
importance has been so frequently emphasised since that it sounds
almost commonplace to-day.</p>

<p>This division of labour effects an easy and natural combination
of economic efforts for the creation of the national dividend. Whereas
animals confine themselves to the direct satisfaction of their individual
needs,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> men produce commodities to exchange them for others
more immediately desired. Hence there results for the community
an enormous increase of wealth; and division of labour, by establishing
the co-operation of all for the satisfaction of the desires of each,
becomes the true source of progress and of well-being.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate the growth in total production as the
outcome of division of labour, Smith gives an example of its effects
in a particular industry. “The effects of the division of labour, in
the general business of society, will be more easily understood by
considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures.”
It is in this connection that he introduces his celebrated
description of the manufacture of pins. “A workman not educated
to this business (which the division of labour has rendered a distinct
trade), nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it
(to the invention of which the same division of labour has probably
given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make
one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the
way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole
work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches,
of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man
draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth
points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make
the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade
by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of
making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct
operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by
distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes
perform two or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of
this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of
them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But
though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated
with the necessary machinery, they could, when they
exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins
in a day.”<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Such is the picture of man as we find him in society. Division
of labour and exchange have resulted in augmenting production
a hundredfold, and thus increasing his well-being, whereas left to
himself he could scarcely supply his most urgent needs.</p>

<p>In a subsequent analysis Smith ascribes the gain resulting from
division of labour to three principal causes: (1) The greater dexterity
acquired by each workman when confined to one particular task;
(2) the economy of time achieved in avoiding constant change
of occupation; (3) the number of inventions and improvements
which suggest themselves to men absorbed in one kind of work.</p>

<p>Criticism has been levelled at Smith for his omission to mention
the disadvantages of division of labour which might possibly counterbalance
its many advantages. The omission is the result of his
method of treating the whole question, and it is not of much
real importance. The disadvantages, moreover, were not altogether
lost sight of, and it would be difficult to find a more eloquent plea
for some counteracting influence than that which Smith puts forward
in the fifth book of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>. “In the progress of the
division of labour,” he remarks, “the employment of the far greater
part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of the people,
comes to be confined to a few very simple operations; frequently to
one or two.” But “the man whose whole life is spent in performing
a few simple operations, of which the effects too are, perhaps, always
the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his
understanding, or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients
for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses,
therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid
and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.”<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>This passage seems in contradiction with the ideas expressed
above. At one moment constant application to one particular kind
of work is regarded as the mother of invention, at another the
unremitting task is branded as a fertile cause of stupefaction. The
contradiction is, however, more apparent than real. An occupation
at first stimulating to the imagination may, if constantly pursued,
result in mental torpor. Smith’s conclusions are at any rate interesting.
In order to remove the inconveniences resulting from over-specialisation
he emphasises the need for bringing within reach of
the people, even of imposing upon them, a system of education
consisting of the three R’s<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>—such education to be supplied through
institutions partly supported by the State. We can imagine the
shock which such heterodoxy must have given to the prophets of
<i>laissez-faire</i>. Fortunately it was not the only one they had to
bear.</p>

<p>Smith next proceeds to indicate the limits of this division of
labour. Of such limits he mentions two: (1) In the first place it
must be limited by the extent of the market. “When the market
is very small, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate
himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange
all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over
and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of
other men’s labour as he has occasion for.”<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> This is why foreign
trade, including trade with the colonies, by extending the market
for some products is favourable to further division of labour and
a further increase of wealth. (2) The other consideration which,
according to Smith, limits division of labour is the quantity of capital
available.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The significance of this observation is not quite so
obvious as that of the former one. Here it seems to us that a
conclusion drawn from one particular trade has been applied to
industry as a whole. It may be true of a private manufacturer that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he will be able to push technical division of labour further than any
of his rivals provided he has more capital than they; but taking
society as a whole it is clear that the existence of division of labour
enables the same product to be produced with less capital than is
necessary for the single producer.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Such is an outline of Adam Smith’s theory of division of labour—a
theory so familiar to everyone to-day that we are often unable to
realise its importance and to appreciate its originality, and this
despite the fact that certain sociologists like Durkheim have
hailed it as supplying the basis of a new ethic. Juxtaposed
with the Physiocratic theory, it is not very difficult to realise its
superiority.</p>

<p>To the Physiocrats the economic world was a hierarchy of classes.
The agriculturist in some mysterious way bore the “whole weary
weight of this unintelligible world” upon his own shoulders, giving
to the other classes a modicum of that sustenance which he had
wrested from the soil. Hence the fundamental importance of the agricultural
classes and the necessity for making the whole economic system
subordinate to them. Adam Smith, on the other hand, attempted
to get a view of production as a whole. He regarded it as the result
of a series of joint undertakings engineered by the various sections
of society and linked together by the tie of exchange. The progress
of each section is bound up with that of every other. To none of
these classes is entrusted the task of keeping all the others alive; all
are equally indispensable. The artisan who spares the labourer the
task of building his house or of making his shoes contributes to the
accumulation of agricultural products just as much as the ploughman
who frees the artisan from turning the furrow or sowing the seed.
The progress of national wealth cannot be measured in terms of a
single net product; it must be estimated by the increase in the
whole mass of commodities placed at the disposal of consumers.</p>

<p>One very evident practical conclusion follows; namely, that
taxation should fall, not upon one class, as the Physiocrats wished,
but upon all classes alike. As against the <i>impôt unique</i>, Smith
advocates multiple taxation which shall strike every source of
revenue equally, labour and capital as well as land; and the fundamental
rule which he lays down is as follows: “The subjects of
every State ought to contribute towards the support of the Government,
as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities;
that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
under the protection of the State.”<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> This is his famous maxim of
equality so frequently quoted in every financial discussion.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>It is very curious that Smith should have failed to make the best
possible use of this theory. Its full significance was lost upon him.
The theory of division of labour alone was sufficient to dispose of
the whole Physiocratic system. Nevertheless, in the last chapter of
Book IV we find him still valiantly struggling to disprove the conclusions
of the Physiocrats, by the aid of arguments not always
very convincing. Forgetting his principle of division of labour, he
even adopts a part of their thesis and finds himself entangled by the
invalid distinctions which they had drawn between productive and
unproductive workers. He simply gives another definition and
describes as unproductive all works which “perish in the very instant
of their performance, and seldom leave any trace or value behind
them for which an equal quantity of service could afterwards be
procured.”<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> All these services, which comprise the labours of
domestic servants, of administrators and magistrates, of soldiers and
priests, of counsellors, doctors, artists, authors, musicians, etc., Say
classed together as “immaterial products.” By restricting the
term “productive” to material objects only, Smith gave rise to a very
useless controversy on the nature of productive and unproductive
works—a controversy that was first taken up by Say and revived
by Mill, but which to-day seems to be decided against Smith,
thanks to a more exact interpretation of his own doctrines. It is,
indeed, quite clear that all these services constitute a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
annual revenue of the nation, and that “production” in a general
sense would be diminished if some persons did not exclusively
devote themselves to the performance of such tasks.</p>

<p>After criticising the Physiocratic distinction drawn between the
wage-earning classes and the productive, Smith immediately admits
that the labour of artisans and traders is not as productive as that
of farmers and agricultural labourers, for the latter not only return
the capital employed by them together with profits, but they also
furnish the proprietor with rent.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Whence this hesitation on the part of Smith? Where did he
come by the idea of the special and superior productivity of agriculture?
An attempt to account for it may prove interesting, and it
will help us to give Smith his true place in a history of economic
doctrines.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his recantation, Smith was never quite rid
of Physiocratic influence. Writing of the Physiocratic system, he
described it as perhaps “the nearest approximation to the truth
that has yet been published.”<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> So indelible was the impression
which the Physiocrats left upon him that both they and their doctrines,
even when the latter are directly opposed to his own, are
always spoken of with the greatest respect. The most important
evidence of their power over him is the thesis just mentioned which
he attempted to defend, namely, that between agriculture and other
industries lies an essential distinction, because in industry and
commerce the forces of nature are never brought into play, whereas
in agriculture they always collaborate with man. “No equal quantity
of productive labour employed in manufactures can ever occasion
so great a reproduction. In them nature does nothing; man does
all; and the reproduction must always be in proportion to the
strength of the agents that occasion it.”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> We almost think we
are dreaming when we read such things in the work of a great economist.
Water, wind, electricity, and steam, are they not natural
forces, and do they not co-operate with man in his task of production?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Considerations such as these were allowed to pass quite unheeded,
and Smith persisted in his error because he believed that this new
doctrine furnished him with an explanation of rent, that strange
enigma which had puzzled English economists for so long. How was
it that while other branches of production gave a return only sufficient
to remunerate the capital and labour employed, agriculture, in
addition to these two revenues, yielded a supplementary income
known as rent? It was because “in agriculture nature labours
along with man: and though her labour costs no expence, its
produce has its value as well as that of the most expensive workman.”
Thus “rent may be considered as the produce of those powers of
nature, the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer.”<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Had
Smith arrived at a true theory of rent this recourse to the natural
powers of the soil to furnish an explanation of the proprietor’s
revenue would have been quite unnecessary, and in all probability
he would not have so easily accepted the idea of the special productivity
of the soil. But this false conception of nature has persisted
in economic theory, and in it Smith thought he saw an additional
reason for adhering to those errors which the Physiocrats had first
induced him to commit.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from his personal attachment to the Physiocrats we must
also remember that Smith more than shared their predilection for
agriculture.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more incorrect, though it is frequently done,
than to regard Smith as the prophet of industrialism and to contrast
him with the Physiocrats, the champions of agriculture. When the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i> appeared in 1776 the economic transformation
known to history as the Industrial Revolution, which consisted
in the rapid substitution of machine production for the old domestic
<i>régime</i>, had as yet scarcely begun. Hargreaves and Arkwright
had doubtless some inventions to their credit. The one had produced
the spinning jenny in 1765, and the other had perfected
the water frame in 1767, improvements that had given considerable
impetus to the cotton trade. James Watt,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> who was known to
Smith, took out a patent for a steam-engine in 1769. But these
inventions were as yet quite novel, and required time before they
could modify the industrial system. The more important among
them, Crompton’s “mule”<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and Cartwright’s weaving machine,
were as yet of the future. These dates are significant; they prove
conclusively that the Industrial Revolution had scarcely begun when
Smith’s great work appeared. Moreover, several of the more
important themes treated of in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> may be discovered
in the course of lectures which Smith delivered at Glasgow
about 1759, so that it is quite impossible to establish anything like
an exact connection between the Industrial Revolution which was
just beginning and the ideas embodied in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>.
One cannot even say that Smith was particularly enamoured of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
manufacturing <i>régime</i>—apart from the mechanical advance which it
implied. For, as Marx says,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> the characteristic trait of English
economic life, despite the undisputed advance that industry was
making at that time, was commercial rather than industrial.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Especially was this true of Glasgow, where Smith made most of his
observations. Glasgow then was an essentially commercial town,
principally engaged in the importation of American tobacco.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Far from constituting a prophetic manifesto of the new age,
Smith’s work reveals even to the most superficial reader a thorough
abhorrence of traders and manufacturers. All his sarcasm is
reserved for them, all his criticism levelled at them. While the
interest of landed proprietors and workers appears to him always to
accord with a country’s general interest, that of traders and manufacturers
“is never exactly the same with that of the public,” the
manufacturers having “generally an interest to deceive and even
to oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many
occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.”<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Again, when it comes to choosing between capitalists and workmen
the issue is not long in doubt. It is quite clear from more
than one passage that Smith’s sympathy was wholly with the workers.
Several paragraphs could be cited in proof of this. Suffice it to
recall the very sympathetic way in which he speaks of the high
wages of workmen and contrast it with his discussion of profits. “Is
this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the
people to be regarded as an advantage or as an inconveniency to
the society? The answer seems at first sight abundantly plain.
Servants, labourers and workmen of different kinds, make up the
far greater part of every great political society. But what improves
the circumstances of the greater part can never be regarded as an
inconveniency to the whole. No society can surely be flourishing
and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor
and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
cloath, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have
such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves
tolerably well fed, cloathed, and lodged.”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The tune changes when
he comes to speak of profits. He is of opinion that high profits
raise the price of commodities much more than high wages, and he
dismisses the consideration of the problem with this ironical remark:
“Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the
bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening
the sale of their goods both at home and abroad. They say nothing
concerning the bad effects of high profits. They are silent with
regard to the pernicious effects of their own gains. They complain
only of those of other people.”<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The contrast is significant. It is
still more deeply marked in that phrase which one is surprised not
to see more frequently quoted by the champions of labour legislation.
“Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences
between masters and their workmen, its counsellors are always the
masters. When the regulation, therefore, is in favour of the workmen,
it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise
when in favour of the masters.”<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>This is not the tone of most of his contemporaries. Nor do we
meet with this note in the writings of the appointed champions of
the industrial system—the MacCullochs, the Ures, and the Babbages
of the next fifty years. His words ring with that generous pity which
proved a source of inspiration to Lord Shaftesbury and Michael Sadler
in their efforts to secure the passing of the Factory Act of 1833.</p>

<p>Smith cannot, accordingly, be regarded as the herald of dawning
industrialism. He clung to agriculture with all the tenacity of his
nature, and no opportunity of showing his preference was ever
missed. The difficulties of agriculture are quite beyond those of
any other craft. “After what are called the fine arts, and the liberal
professions, however, there is perhaps no trade which requires so
great a variety of knowledge and experience.”<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Not only is it more
difficult, but it is also more useful. Between agriculture, manufacture,
and commerce he draws a long comparison (to which we
shall have to make reference again) purporting to show that of all
employments agriculture is the most profitable field of investment,
and the one most in accord with the general interest. For the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
progressive nations “the natural course of things” would seem to
suggest the investment of capital firstly in agriculture, in the second
place in industry, and finally in foreign trade. The whole of
Book III is an endeavour to show how the policy of European
nations had for many centuries been hostile to agriculture and how
the natural order had been inverted in the interests of merchants
and artisans. Agriculture had always been the victim. In his
theory of taxation he shows how a portion of the taxes on profits
and wages ultimately falls upon property. In his discussion of
duties on imported corn—those duties which aroused the indignation
of Ricardo against the landlords—he reveals the same partiality. And
he even goes the length of saying that it is not because of their
personal interest, but owing solely to a badly conceived imitation of
the doings of merchants and manufacturers, that “the country gentlemen
and farmers of Great Britain so far forgot the generosity which
is natural to their station, as to demand the exclusive privilege of
supplying their countrymen with corn and butchers’-meat.”<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Smith’s preference for agriculture and agriculturists need not be
further insisted upon. Despite his own theory of division of labour,
he still cherished a secret regard for the Physiocratic prejudice. He
never subjected agriculture to the indignity of equal treatment along
with other forms of economic activity. In his work at least it still
retains its ancient pre-eminence.</p>

<h4 id="heading9">II: THE “NATURALISM” AND “OPTIMISM” OF
SMITH</h4>

<p>In addition to the conception of the economic world as a great
natural community created by division of labour, we can distinguish
in Smith’s work two other fundamental ideas, around which his
more characteristic theories group themselves. First is the idea of the
spontaneous origin of economic institutions, and secondly their beneficent
character—or, more briefly, Smith’s naturalism and optimism.</p>

<p>The two ideas, though frequently intermingled and sometimes
even confused in Smith’s work, must be carefully distinguished by
the historian of economic thought.</p>

<p>Spontaneity and beneficence were intimately connected for Smith.
In the eighteenth century anything natural or spontaneous was
immediately voted good, and the terms “natural,” “just,” and
“advantageous” were often used as synonymous. Smith did not
escape the confusion of ideas. Having shown the natural origin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
economic institutions, he imagined that at the same time he had
demonstrated their useful and beneficent character.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The confusion
is no longer permissible. To give a scientific demonstration of the
origin of social institutions and to gauge their value from the point of
view of the general interest are two equally legitimate but very
different intellectual pursuits. We may agree with Smith that our
economic organisations, both in their origin and functions, participate
of the spontaneity of natural organisms, but we may at the same time
reserve judgment as to their real worth. Pessimism no less than
optimism may be engendered by contemplation of the spontaneous
character of economic institutions. While this conception of the
spontaneity of economic institutions seems to us just and fruitful,
the demonstration given of their beneficent character appears insufficient
and doubtful. The former conception is a commonplace
with all the greatest economists; the latter is rejected by the
majority of them.</p>

<p>These two ideas which have played such an important part in
the history of economic doctrines must be separately examined.</p>

<p>The conception of spontaneity is the one to which Smith refers
most frequently. <i>Il mondo va da se.</i> Here at any rate he and the
Physiocrats were entirely at one. There is no need for organisation,
no call for the intervention of any general will, however far-seeing
or reasonable, and no necessity for any preliminary understanding
between men. Such are the reflections that the study of the
economic world suggests ever anew to our author. The present
aspect of the economic world is the result of the spontaneous action
of millions of individuals, each of whom follows his own sweet will,
taking no heed of others, but never doubting the ultimate result.
The noble outlines of the economic world as we know it have been
traced, not by following a plan issuing complete from the brain of
an organiser and deliberately carried out by an intelligent society,
but by the accumulation of numberless deeds designed by a crowd
of individuals in obedience to an instinctive force wholly unconscious
of the work which it was encompassing.</p>

<p>This idea of the spontaneous constitution of the economic world
is in some aspects analogous to the conception of an “economic
law” of a later period. Both ideas suggest the presence of something
superior to individual wills, and imposed upon them even despite
their resistance. The differences are equally marked, however, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
scope of the former being far greater than that of the latter. The
words “natural law,” in the first place, suggest regularity and repetition—the
constant recurrence of the same phenomena under similar
conditions. This is not the aspect that particularly struck Smith.
He insists less upon the constancy of economic phenomena and more
on their spontaneity, their instinctive and natural character. Say’s
delight was to compare the economic and the physical worlds.
Smith loves to regard the economic world as a living organism which
creates for itself its own indispensable organs. Nowhere is the term
“economic law” employed, but his delineation of the chief economic
institutions and the account of their functions always results in the
same conclusion.</p>

<p>First of all take division of labour, which we have just studied,
and which more than any other institution contributes to the increase
of wealth.</p>

<p>This marvellous institution is “not originally the effect of any
human wisdom, which foresees and intends that general opulence to
which it gives occasion.” “It is the necessary, though very slow
and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature
which has in view no such extensive utility; the propensity to
truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> This tendency
itself is the outcome of personal interest. “Man has almost constant
occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to
expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to
prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favour, and show them
that it is for their advantage to do for him what he requires of them.
Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this:
Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want,
is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that
we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices
which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the
butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but
from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not
to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of
our own necessities, but of their advantages.”<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> This gives rise to
exchange, and with exchange comes division of labour. “And thus
the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the
produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption,
for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a
particular occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection
whatever talent or genius he may possess for that particular species
of business.” Division of labour is the outcome of a tendency
common to all men, the tendency to barter; and this tendency itself
is spontaneously developed under the influence of personal interest,
which acts simultaneously for the benefit of each and all.</p>

<p>Next comes money, and nothing has so facilitated exchange or
so greatly increased wealth. Every economic treatise since Smith’s
has demonstrated its advantages in terms almost identical with his.
But how did money first come to be employed? It was not by the
act of a public body, nor was it the outcome of a nation’s reflective
judgment. It is simply the result of the operation of a collective
instinct. Some men who were keener than others saw the inconveniences
of the truck system. And “in order to avoid the inconveniency
of such situations, every prudent man in every period of
society, after the first establishment of the division of labour, must
naturally have endeavoured to manage his affairs in such a manner,
as to have at all times by him, besides the peculiar produce of his
own industry, a certain quantity of some one commodity or other,
such as he imagined few people would be likely to refuse in exchange
for the produce of their industry.”<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Money is thus the product of
the simultaneous though not concerted action of a great number
of people, each obeying his personal inclination. The intervention
of the public authority is much later, and its object is merely to
guarantee by means of a design the weight and purity of such coins
as are already in circulation.</p>

<p>Take another well-known phenomenon—capital.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> With the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
exception of division of labour and the invention of money, Smith
thought there was no phenomenon of greater importance and no
more essential fount of national wealth than capital. The larger
the store of capital, the greater the number of productive workers,
makers of tools and machinery—the essentials of increased productivity—the
further will division of labour extend. To increase a
nation’s capital is to expand its industry and to further its well-being.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
In some passages the growth of wealth appears not merely
as the chief but as the only method of augmenting a nation’s wealth.
“The industry of the society can augment only in proportion as its
capital augments, and its capital can augment only in proportion to
what can be gradually saved out of its revenue.”<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> In short, capital
limits industry,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> a phrase that was destined to become classic, and
one that was repeated by every economist down to Mill. Capital is
the true source of economic life. Let capital increase and industry
will expand in every direction; diminish it and a bar is set to all
improvement. Capital fertilises the earth, whereas the labour of
man simply leaves it a weary waste.</p>

<p>Criticism has been freely levelled at this extravagant importance
which capital is made to assume. It is certainly somewhat curious
that labour should now be treated as altogether subordinate to
capital, whereas earlier in the volume labour alone was regarded as
the great wealth-producing agent. But we are not here concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with the revival of these threadbare controversies.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> We merely wish
to note that Smith finds in this accumulation of capital a new
illustration of spontaneity. The saving of capital is not the result of
any foresight on the part of society, but is solely due to the simultaneous
and concurrent actions of thousands of individuals. These
individuals, urged on by a desire to better their situation, are
spontaneously urged to save their earnings and to employ those
savings productively.</p>

<p>“The principle which prompts to save, is the desire of bettering
our condition, a desire which, though generally calm and dispassionate,
comes with us from the womb, and never leaves us till we go
into the grave.… An augmentation of fortune is the means by
which the greater part of men propose and wish to better their condition.
It is the means the most vulgar and the most obvious; and
the most likely way of augmenting their fortune, is to save and
accumulate some part of what they acquire.” This desire is so
powerful that even the greatest follies perpetrated by Governments
have never succeeded in annulling its beneficial effects. “The
uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better
his condition, the principle from which public and national as well
as private opulence is originally derived, is frequently powerful
enough to maintain the natural progress of things toward improvement,
in spite both of the extravagance of government, and of the
greatest errors of administration. Like the unknown principle of
animal life, it frequently restores health and vigour to the constitution,
in spite, not only of the disease, but of the absurd prescriptions of
the doctor.”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>But the idea of the spontaneity of economic institutions finds its
most interesting illustration in the theory of demand and supply,
upon which we must dwell a little.</p>

<p>In a society based upon division of labour, where everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
produces for a market without any previous arrangement with his
fellow producers and without any external direction, the great difficulty
lies in adapting the amount of goods supplied to the amount
demanded. How, as a matter of fact, are these producers to know
at any particular moment what they ought to produce and in what
quantities? Moreover, who is to direct and who can restrain
them? It is true that Smith was careful to point out that they are
not concerned with the satisfaction of all needs, of whatever kind
they may be. Their duty lies towards what he calls the “effectual,”
not the “absolute,” demand. By effectual demand we are to understand
the demand of those who are capable of offering not merely
something in exchange for the products which they desire, but of
offering at least enough to cover the expenses of raising those
products.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Society founded upon division of labour and exchange
implies that nothing can be gratuitous and every loss involves a
sacrifice on the part of some person or other.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> But if production is
carried on in this haphazard fashion how are we to avoid an
occasional over-production or an accidental under-supply?</p>

<p>Before we can understand this we must acquaint ourselves with
Adam Smith’s theory of prices.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter we had occasion to note how Condillac
in 1776 put forward a theory of value which was altogether superior
to the Physiocrats’. Smith’s book, also published in 1776, betrays
not the least sign of Condillac’s influence, and the new theory never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
comes up for discussion. The very success of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>
had eclipsed the fame of the French philosopher, and Smith’s theory,
though quite inferior to Condillac’s, held the field for so many years
simply because it won the allegiance of the English economists, whose
influence was paramount throughout the first half of the nineteenth
century. Its popularity only waned with the publication of the
works of Walras, Jevons, and Menger. Its historic interest is further
enhanced by the fact that it had the singular good fortune to win
the approval both of the socialists and the Liberal economists. It
is the fate of writers like Smith, remarkable for wealth of ideas
rather than for logical presentation, to impel minds along different
and sometimes even opposite paths. Unfortunately the theory of
value is not the only one that presents a somewhat hazy outline.
We cannot here enter into the details of the theory, but must content
ourselves with a mere sketch of it. Even this, however, will immediately
enable us to understand its insufficiency, and appreciate the
twofold influence which it exercised upon subsequent doctrines.</p>

<p>Smith opens his treatment by emphasising the fundamental
distinction which exists between “value in use” and “value in
exchange.”<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> By value in use he means almost<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> exactly what we
understand by utility, or what other writers call subjective value,
desirability, or ophelimity.</p>

<p>Present-day economists when treating of prices—the exchange
value of things—chiefly rely upon this conception of “value in use.”
The explanation of the “ratio of exchange” of commodities is based
upon a previous analysis of their utility for those who exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
them. Smith proceeds in a different fashion. “Value in use” is
mentioned, but only for the purpose of contrasting it with value in
exchange. It is then dismissed without further consideration. The
two notions seem to have no point of contact. Value in exchange
was the only one that was of any interest to Smith; hence there
was all the more reason for denying its derivative character.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Thus from the very first the only avenue that might have led to a
satisfactory solution of this problem of prices was closed. One could
easily have predicted that this was bound to land Smith in difficulty;
as a matter of fact he is doubly involved.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Two different but equally
erroneous solutions have been successively adopted by him, but he
has never actually decided between them. The socialists and
economists who are to follow will be engaged in the same task, and
the cleavage between them will be marked by their adoption of one
or other of these two theories.</p>

<p>Smith was led to the study of prices because he wished to know
something of the constant oscillation which is such a feature of their
history. The actual or market price is unstable because of the
unstable connection between demand and supply,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> or, as he puts it,
“It is adjusted, however, not by any accurate measure, but by
the higgling and bargaining of the market, according to that sort of
rough equality which, though not exact, is sufficient for carrying on
the business of common life.”<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> It seemed impossible that their
perpetual fluctuation should represent the true value of the commodity.
Its real value could not vary from this moment to the
next or from one place to another. Underneath the constantly
oscillating market price may be discerned another price, referred to
by Smith as the real or sometimes as the natural price. The
discovery of a more stable and a more constant element beneath the
continual fluctuations of price movements still constitutes the great
problem of pure economics.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Smith’s first theory makes the true value of any commodity
depend upon the amount of labour or effort it has taken to produce.
“Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value
of all commodities.” “The real price of every thing, what every thing
really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble
of acquiring it.”<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Labour—that is, the effort expended upon the
production of a commodity—is both the origin and the measure of
its exchange value. The theory that labour or effort is the cause
of value (if value can be said to have a cause) was first formulated
by the father of political economy himself. It is curious to think
that it was this same theory that was used with such good effect by
Karl Marx in his attack upon capitalism.</p>

<p>This first attempt to find a firmer foundation for exchange value
than that afforded by the shifting sands of demand and supply was
scarcely made before Smith became aware of some difficulties in the
path. For example, how was this work and the value dependent
upon it to be measured? “There may be more labour in an hour’s
hard work than in two hours’ easy business; or in an hour’s application
to a trade which it cost ten years’ labour to learn, than in a
month’s industry at an ordinary and obvious employment. But it
is not easy to find any accurate measure either of hardship or
ingenuity.”<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> A second objection arises when the theory is applied
to civilized society. Work by itself cannot produce anything;
something must be contributed by both land and capital. But
neither of these is a free good, and they must cost something to those
who employ them. Accordingly primitive societies<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> are the only
ones where “the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring
or producing any commodity is the only circumstance determining
its value.” We must nowadays take some account of land and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
capital. So that labour is not the only source of value, nor is it
its sole measure.</p>

<p>Another hypothesis becomes necessary forthwith. This time cost
of production is hit upon as the likely regulator of value. Hitherto
the “real” price has signified the price that is based upon labour.
Now the “natural” price is defined as the price of goods valued at
their cost of production. The change of name is not of any great
significance. What Smith was in search of on both occasions was
that true value which always kept in hiding behind the fluctuations
of market prices. It is the same problem, but with a new solution.
Just now we were informed that if a commodity sold at a price
representing the labour which it cost to produce, that price would
also represent its real cost. With no less assurance we are now told
that a commodity sold at cost of production “is then sold precisely
for what it is worth, or for what it really costs the person who brings
it to market.”<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The true value of goods corresponds to their cost of
production. By this we are to understand a sum sufficient to pay
at normal rates the wages of labour, the interest of capital, and the
rent of land, all of which have collaborated in the production of
the particular commodity.</p>

<p>Smith, having discarded labour, finds a new determinant of value
in cost of production, and if socialists rallied to his first hypothesis
the great majority of economists right up to Jevons have clung to
his second. As for Smith himself, he never had the courage to
choose between them. They remain juxtaposed in the <i>Wealth of
Nations</i> because he never made up his mind which to adopt. As a
result his work is full of contradictions which it would be futile to
try to reconcile. For example, land and capital in one place are
regarded as sources of new values, adding to and increasing the value
which labour creates, and producing normally an element of profit
and rent, which, together with the wages of labour, makes up the
cost of production. In another connection they are treated as
deductions made by capitalists and landlords from the value created
by labour alone.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Some writers accordingly argue that Smith must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
have been a socialist. On the whole the cost of production theory
prevailed, and the natural price of commodities is taken to mean
that price which coincides with their cost of production. As to
market price, he makes the remark that it is higher or lower than the
natural price according as the quantity offered diminishes or increases
as compared with the quantity demanded.</p>

<p>Such is Smith’s theory of prices. The element of truth which it
contains, namely, that the prices of goods tend to coincide with their
cost of production (the remark is not originally Smith’s at all), must
not blind us to its many faults. It is open to at least two very
serious objections.</p>

<p>An attempt is made to explain the price of goods by referring
to the price of the services (wages, interest, and rent) which make up
the cost of production. When the cost of those services comes up
for consideration it is assumed that their cost is dependent upon the
price of the goods. Wages, for example, are determined by the
selling price of the commodities which labour has produced. Escape
from the vicious circle is only possible by availing ourselves of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
modern theory of economic equilibrium. That theory shows us
how prices generally, whether of goods or of services, are interdependent;
all being determined simultaneously—like the unknown
in an algebraical formula—just when the exchange is taking place.
But this theory of economic equilibrium was, of course, unknown to
Smith.</p>

<p>Cost of production being the regulator of price, it is very
important that an analysis of cost of production and a study of the
causes which determine the rates of wages, profit, and rent should be
made. One might have expected that this study would have cleared
away any obscurity that still clung to the theory of prices. But
this analysis is one of the least satisfactory portions of Smith’s work.
We have already had occasion to note the unsatisfactory character
of his theory of rent. That of profits—which Smith fails to distinguish
from interest—is equally useless;<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and his theory of wages
is hopelessly inconsistent. He hesitates between the subsistence
theory of wages and the other theory which makes them depend
upon the relations between demand and supply, without ever making
a final choice.</p>

<p>We cannot agree with Say in considering Smith’s theory of
distribution one of his best claims to fame. His treatment of this
problem, which afterwards became the kernel of Ricardian economics,
is altogether inferior to his handling of production. We also know
that this is the least original part of his work. It was simply added
as a kind of afterthought, the original intention being to deal
only with production. This becomes evident if we compare the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i> with the Glasgow course of 1763, the whole of
which is devoted to production. The addition of a theory of
distribution to the original skeleton was probably due to the
Physiocrats, with whom in the meantime he had become acquainted;
and the hesitations and uncertainties which mar this part of the
work merely go to prove that Smith had not thought it out as
clearly as the other sections.</p>

<p>The subject cannot be pursued here. We can only point to the
inference which Smith draws from his theory of value, and how it is
made to support the contention that demand adapts itself spontaneously
to the conditions of supply. This is how Smith explains
the continual oscillation of prices: “When the quantity brought to
market exceeds the effectual demand, it cannot be all sold to those
who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent, wages and profit,
which must be paid in order to bring it thither. Some part must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sold to those who are willing to pay less, and the low price which
they give for it must reduce the price of the whole. The market
price will sink more or less below the natural price according as the
greatness of the excess increases more or less the competition of the
sellers, or according as it happens to be more or less important to
them to get immediately rid of the commodity.” The reverse will
happen when demand exceeds supply. “When the quantity brought
to market is just sufficient to supply the effectual demand and no
more, the market price naturally comes to be either exactly, or as
nearly as can be judged of, the same with the natural price. The
whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this price, and
cannot be disposed of for more. The competition of the different
dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not oblige
them to accept of less.” Thus “the quantity of every commodity
brought to market naturally suits itself to the effectual demand.”<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>And this very remarkable result is simply the outcome of personal
interest. “If at any time it exceeds the effectual demand, some of
the component parts of its price must be paid below their natural
rate. If it is rent, the interest of the landlords will immediately
prompt them to withdraw a part of their land; and if it is wages or
profit, the interest of the labourers in the one case, and of their
employers in the other, will prompt them to withdraw a part of
their labour or stock from this employment. The quantity brought to
market will soon be no more than sufficient to supply the effectual
demand. All the different parts of its price will rise to their natural
rate, and the whole price to the natural price.”</p>

<p>And so, in the majority of cases at least, this natural and spontaneous
mechanism secures a constant balancing of the quantities of
goods produced and the quantities effectively demanded. The
circumstances under which such a result does not follow are really
quite exceptional—although Smith does not deny that sometimes
they do exist. Whenever such conditions obtain—that is, when the
market price remains for a considerable length of time above the
natural price—we find that it is always due to the capitalists’ action
in concealing the high rate of profits which they draw, or in retaining
possession of some patent or natural monopoly, such as wine of a
special quality. It occasionally happens also as the result of an
artificial monopoly.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But these are mere exceptions, their rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
occurrence confirming the fundamental rule concerning the spontaneous
adaptation of the quantity offered to the quantity demanded,
thanks to this oscillation of the market price about the natural.</p>

<p>This theory of adaptation, we know, is one of the most important
in the whole of political economy. Since Smith wrote it has been
reproduced by almost every economist, and without any very
substantial alteration. It remains even to this day the basis of our
theory of production.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the manner in which Smith makes use of
his theory to illustrate his thesis. We shall refer to two cases which
are intrinsically important as well as affording admirable illustrations
of that spontaneity upon which Smith laid such stress.</p>

<p>The first concerns population. Population, like commodities,
may be superabundant or it may be insufficient. What regulates its
numbers? “The number of people,” Smith replies, “depends upon
the demand of society, and this is how it works. Among the
proletariat, generally speaking, children are plentiful enough. It is
only when wages are very low that poverty and misery cause the
death of many of them; but when wages are fairly high several of
them manage to reach maturity.” “It deserves to be remarked,
too,” he continues, “that it necessarily does this as nearly as
possible in the proportion which the demand for labour requires. If
this demand is continually increasing, the reward of labour must
necessarily encourage in such a manner the marriage and multiplication
of labourers as may enable them to supply that continually
increasing demand by a continually increasing population. If the
reward should at any time be less than what was requisite for this
purpose, the deficiency of hands would soon raise it; and if it should
at any time be more, their excessive multiplication would soon lower
it to this necessary rate. The market would be so much under-stocked
with labour in the one case, and so much over-stocked in the other, as
would soon force back its price to that proper rate which the circumstances
of the society required. It is in this manner that the demand
for men, like that for any other commodity, necessarily regulates the
production of men; quickens it when it goes on too slowly, and
stops it when it advances too fast.”<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The second case relates to the demand for money and its supply.
We have already seen how the problem of its origin is solved.
Alongside of that problem is now placed another, namely, how
is the quantity in circulation regulated to meet the requirements
of exchange? Smith’s first task was to expose the popular fallacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
concerning this topic.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> According to one school of thinkers, money
was wealth <i>par excellence</i>, and it was all the more important that he
should get rid of this view seeing that it constituted the very
foundation of the Mercantile theory, the overthrow of which was the
immediate object in publishing the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>. The Mercantilists
contended that a country should export more than it imports,
receiving the balance in money. If it can be proved that this balance
is useless because money is a mere commodity possessing no greater
and no less utility than any other, then the Mercantilist foundation
is completely destroyed. Smith thought that money was less
indispensable than some other goods, seeing that we are anxious to
pass it on as often as we can. The disdain with which Smith
regarded money was the result of a reaction against Mercantilism,
and it led some of his followers to over-emphasise his point of view
and to misconceive the special character of monetary phenomena.
A nation’s true wealth “consists,” Smith tells us, “not in its gold
and silver only, but in its lands, houses, and consumable goods of
all different kinds.”<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> “It is the annual produce of the land and
labour of the society.”<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Hence in evaluating a country’s net revenue
we must omit money because it is not consumed. It only serves
as an instrument for the circulation of wealth and for the measurement
of value. It is the “great wheel of circulation.”<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> In virtue
of this title, although Smith himself classed money along with circulating
capital, he remarks that it might be likened to the fixed
capital of an industry, to machinery or workshops. The greater the
economy in the use of fixed capital, provided there is no diminution
in production, the better, for the larger will be the net product.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
This is equally true of money—a necessary but a very costly instrument
of social production. “Every saving in the expence of collecting
and supporting that part of the circulating capital which consists
in money is an improvement of exactly the same kind”<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> as that
which reduces the fixed capital of industry.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>This is why bank-notes—the circulation of which diminishes the
quantity of money needed—have proved such a precious invention.
What they do is to set free a certain quantity of gold and silver which
may be sent abroad to pay for machinery and other instruments of
production, and which will in turn increase the true revenue of the
country. Smith’s parable in which he illustrates these advantages,
has long since become classic: “The gold and silver money which
circulates in any country may very properly be compared to a highway,
which, while it circulates and carries to market all the grass
and corn of the country, produces itself not a single pile of either.
The judicious operations of banking, by providing, if I may be
allowed so violent a metaphor, a sort of waggon-way through the
air; enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part of its
highways into good pastures and cornfields, and thereby to increase
very considerably the annual produce of its land and labour.”<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion is that every policy—the Mercantilist, for example—which
aims at increasing the quantity of money within the country,
whether by direct or indirect methods, is absurd, for money, far
from being indispensable, is really an encumbrance.</p>

<p>It is not only absurd, but also useless. Have we not seen already
that money is a mere commodity designed to facilitate circulation
and that the demand for it is entirely determined by that object?
But the supply of any commodity usually adapts itself spontaneously
to the demand for it. No one concerns himself with supplying the
nation with wine or with crockery. Why trouble about money?<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
If the quantity of goods diminishes, exchange slackens and a part
of the money becomes useless. But “the interest of whoever
possesses it requires that it should be employed.”<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
“it will, in spite of all laws and prohibitions, be sent abroad, and
employed in purchasing consumable goods which may be of some
use at home.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, as the prosperity of a nation grows it necessarily
attracts the precious metals because a multiplication of
exchanges leads to a growing demand for money. These exportations
and importations will depend, as Hume<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> had already shown,
upon the relative cheapness or dearness of money. What is true
of metallic money is also true of a special kind of money known
as bank-notes. Smith has given us a vivid description of the functions
of banks, and especially of the fortunes of the most famous bank of
this period, the Bank of Amsterdam. This afforded him another
opportunity of demonstrating how the quantity of notes offered
spontaneously adapts itself to the quantity demanded. If banks
issue more notes than the circulation warrants prices will rise. Buying
from foreign countries will be resorted to and the notes will be
returned to the banks to be exchanged for gold and silver—the only
international money. The banks clearly have no interest in issuing
too many notes, because it involves a greater metallic reserve as
the result of the more frequent demands for payment which they
will have to face. Of course, “every particular banking company
has not always understood or attended to its own particular interest,
and the circulation has frequently been over-stocked with paper
money.”<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> But this does not affect the main principle, and we have
one further proof of the spontaneous activity of the economic
mechanism.</p>

<p>We have now reviewed some of Smith’s principal themes, and we
have seen how every phenomenon impresses him in the same fashion.
Had space permitted we might have cited other examples all pointing
to the same conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> This conception of spontaneity and wise
beneficence is by no means the product of mere <i>a priori</i> thinking. It
was no abstract theory that needed the backing of a rigid demonstration.
It was a belief gradually borne in upon him in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
his review of the economic field. This is characteristic of all his
thought, and with every new vista we are reminded of it. The
conclusion is hinted at again and again, and the impression left upon
the reader’s mind is that no other conclusion could ever be possible.
Smith thought of the economic order as an organism—the creation
of a thousand human wills unconscious of the end whither they are
tending, but all of them obedient to the impulse of one instinctive,
powerful force. This force, the root of all economic activity, its
constancy and uniformity triumphant over every artificial obstacle
and giving unity to the whole system, what is it?</p>

<p>We have already encountered it on more than one occasion. It
is personal interest, or, as Smith prefers to call it, “the natural effort
of every individual to better his own condition.”<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Hidden deep in
the heart of every individual lies this essential spring of human life
and social progress.</p>

<p>Doubtless it is not the only one. Smith is never exclusive. He
knew that there were other passions<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> besides self-interest, and he is
not afraid of naming them, as when he attributes an economic
revolution which had such beneficial effects as the emancipation of
the rural classes to “the most childish vanity of proprietors.”<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
Neither did he omit to point out that personal interest is not equally
strong in the breast of every one, and that there is the greatest
diversity in human motives. All this he had forgotten, according to
some of his critics, while others charge him with the creation of the
<i>homo œconomicus</i>, a poor representation of reality and a mere automaton
exclusively guided by material interests. Someone has
remarked that if you add to this figure a tinge of patriotism you have
a faithful picture of the Englishman and Scotsman of his day. Had
he been acquainted with Germans or Frenchmen, with their less
sordid attachment to material gain, he might have judged differently.
It may be that our reading of him is incorrect. He seems to have
taken care to note that his remarks do not apply to <i>all</i>, but only
to the generality of men. He continually recalls the fact that
he is speaking of men of common understanding,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> or of those gifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with common prudence.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> He knew well enough that the principles
of common prudence do not always govern the conduct of <i>every</i>
individual, but he was of opinion that they always influenced
that of the majority of every class and order.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> His reasoning is
applicable to men <i>en masse</i>, and not to individuals in particular.
Moreover, he does not deny that man may be unacquainted with
or may even entirely ignore his own interest. We have just quoted
a passage wherein he remarks that bankers who temporarily issue too
many notes are at that moment ignorant of their own interests.</p>

<p>These reservations notwithstanding, and full account being taken
of all the exceptions to the principle as laid down by Smith, it is still
true to say that as a general thesis he considers “the natural effort
of every individual to better his own condition”—that is, personal
interest—as the fundamental psychological motive in political
economy. Any reference to the case of business men who are really
actuated by a desire to take general welfare as their guide in matters
of conduct is treated with a measure of scepticism which it is difficult
not to share. “I have never known much good done by those who
affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed,
not very common among merchants, and very few words need be
employed in dissuading them from it.”<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Not that sentiment does
not play a part, and a very important part, in the philosophy of
Smith; but sentiment, or sympathy, as he calls it, has the domain
of morality for its own, while interest dominates that of economics.
All his thinking led him to a firm belief in a spontaneous economic
order founded and guided by self-interest.</p>

<p>Comparison with the Physiocratic doctrine concerning the
natural and essential order of societies is illuminating. To the
Physiocrats the “natural order” implied a system—an ideal. It
required a genius to discover it, and only an enlightened despotism
could realise it. For Smith the “spontaneous order” was a fact.
It was not a thing to be brought into being. It already existed. It
was doubtless held in check by a hundred imperfections, including,
among others, the stupidity of human legislation.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> But it was
triumphant over them all. Beneath the artificial constitution of
society lay the natural constitution which completely dominated it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
This natural constitution, which for the Physiocrats was nothing
more than an ideal, Smith discovered in actual operation, and he was
able to describe its <i>modus operandi</i>. Political economy, which with
Quesnay was nothing better than a system of rules and regulations,
became in Smith’s hands a natural science based upon the observation
and analysis of existing facts. In a passage written in his usual
lucid style Smith shows the superiority of his system over that of the
Physiocrats. “Some speculative physicians seem to have imagined
that the health of the human body could be preserved only by a
certain precise regimen of diet and exercise, of which every, the
smallest, violation necessarily occasioned some degree of disease or
disorder proportioned to the degree of the violation.… Mr.
Quesnai, who was himself a physician, and a very speculative physician,
seems to have entertained a notion of the same kind concerning
the political body, and to have imagined that it would thrive and
prosper only under a certain precise regimen, the exact regimen of
perfect liberty and perfect justice. He seems not to have considered
that in the political body, the natural effort which every man is
continually making to better his own condition, is a principle of
preservation capable of preventing and correcting, in many respects,
the bad effects of a political œconomy in some degree both partial
and oppressive. Such a political œconomy, though it no doubt retards
more or less, is not always capable of stopping altogether the natural
progress of a nation towards wealth and prosperity, and still less of
making it go backwards. If a nation could not prosper without the
enjoyment of perfect liberty and perfect justice, there is not in the
world a nation which could ever have prospered. In the political
body, however, the wisdom of nature has fortunately made ample
provision for remedying many of the bad effects of the folly and
injustice of man; in the same manner as it has done in the natural
body, for remedying those of his sloth and intemperance.”<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>This passage leads us to his second thesis, namely, the excellence
of these economic institutions. As we have already remarked, these
two ideas of spontaneity and excellence, though confused by Smith,
ought to be treated apart. His naturalism and optimism are
inseparable, and both of them find expression in the same paragraph.
The passage just quoted affords a proof of this. Personal interest
not only creates and maintains the economic organism, but at the
same time ensures a nation’s progress towards wealth and prosperity.
The institutions are not only natural, but are also beneficial. They
interest him not merely as objects of scientific curiosity, but also as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the instruments of public weal. Herein lies their chief attraction
for him, for political economy to him was more of a practical art
than a science.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>But this is hardly emphatic enough. Natural economic institutions
are not merely good: they are providential. Divine Providence
has endowed man with a desire to better his condition,
whence arises the “natural” social organism: so that man, following
where this desire leads, is really accomplishing the beneficent designs
of God Himself. By pursuing his own interest, man “is in this as
in many other cases” (he is writing now of the employment of
capital) “led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no
part of his intention.”<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The Physiocrats could hardly have improved
upon that.</p>

<p>We can scarcely share in his optimism to-day. But it has played
too prominent a <i>rôle</i> in the history of ideas not to detain us for a
moment. We must examine the arguments upon which it is based
and endeavour to grasp their import.</p>

<p>Let us note, in the first place, that every example hitherto deduced
with a view to proving the spontaneity of economic institutions at
the same time furnishes a demonstration of the beneficial effects of
personal interest. Owing to a coincidence by no means fortuitous
every institution mentioned by Smith as owing its existence to the
prevalence of action of this kind is at the same time favourable to
economic progress. Division of labour, the invention of money, and
the accumulation of capital are so many natural social facts that
also increase wealth. The adaptation of demand and supply, the
distribution of money according to the need for a circulating medium,
the growth of population according to the demand for it, are so
many spontaneous phenomena which ensure the efficient working of
economic society. A perusal of Smith’s work leaves us with the
impression that these spontaneous institutions must also be the
best.</p>

<p>The general proof of this thesis is scattered throughout the
whole book. But there was one point especially upon which Smith
was very anxious to show complete accord between public and
private interest. This was in connection with the investment of
capital. In his opinion capital spontaneously seeks, and as spontaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
finds, the most favourable field for investment—most
favourable, that is to say, to the interest of society in general. This
proof at first sight seems to apply only to one special fact, but
it really has a more general import. We know the great stress
which Smith laid upon capital. Division of labour depends upon
it, and so does the abundance or scarcity of produce. It determines
the quantity of work and fixes the limit of population. To show
that the investment of capital conforms to the general interest is to
show that all production is organised in the manner most favourable
to national prosperity.</p>

<p>Smith distinguishes between four methods of investing capital:
in agriculture, in industry, in the wholesale and in the retail trades.
Wholesale industry is further divided into three classes: domestic
trade; foreign trade, furnishing the nation with foreign products;
and the carrying trade which transports those goods from one country
to another. Smith maintained that the order in which these various
forms of activity were mentioned was also the order of their utility,
agriculture being the most advantageous, industry the second
best, etc.</p>

<p>He also proposes two criteria for testing this hierarchy: (1) the
quantity of productive labour put into operation by means of the
capital employed by each; (2) the amount of exchange value
annually added to the revenue by each of these employments. As
we pass from agriculture to the other branches, the quantity of
productive labour brought into operation and the amount of exchange
value obtained gradually decreases, and with this decrease goes a
diminishing utility for the country. Smith thought that a nation
ought to employ its capital in the way he had suggested. It ought
to give the preference to agriculture, and engage in the other
branches only as the accumulation of capital permitted.</p>

<p>But this is precisely what the capitalists would do were they
entirely free. Every one of them, in fact, is interested in keeping
his capital as near home as possible, with a view to better supervision.
Only as a last resource does he venture to engage in foreign
commerce. Again, even among the industries carried on in his own
country every capitalist will preferably choose that which will result
in the production of the greatest exchange value, seeing that his profit
varies with the amount of this exchange value. His investments
will accordingly be made in the order mentioned, an order which
roughly corresponds to the greater or lesser quantity of exchange
values produced by each industry. And finally, when contemplating
investment in foreign trade he will for the same reason follow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
order specified above—the order of greatest general utility. Thus the
double desire of keeping one’s capital within one’s reach and of
finding for it the most lucrative field of investment leads every
capitalist to employ his capital in the fashion which is most advantageous
for the nation. Such is the argument, whatever its value.</p>

<p>Even if we adopted his criteria it is obvious that his classification
is altogether too arbitrary. How, for example, can we justify the
statement that an industrial enterprise or the carrying trade employs
less capital than agriculture? The exact contrary would be nearer
the truth, and agriculture ought to be given a much more modest
position. Moreover, the conception of such a hierarchy does not
accord very well with the theory of division of labour, which seeks
to put the various forms of human activity more nearly on an
equality.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we cannot even accept a criterion which takes
the amount of exchange values furnished by an industry as the test
of its social utility. This increase in the quantity of exchange values
simply proves that the demand for the goods concerned is stronger
than the demand for some others. When capital flows into
certain industries it only points to the spontaneous satisfaction of
social demand. But social demand and social utility are not
necessarily the same. Demand is the outcome of human desires,
and its intensity depends upon the revenue drawn by the individual.
But we can neither regard these desires in themselves or the system
of distribution that makes such desires “effective” as sufficient tests
of social utility. And to say that production follows demand is to
prove nothing at all. Smith himself seems to have realised this;
hence his other criterion—the quantity of productive labour employed
by capital. According to this test those industries that
employ the least amount of machinery and the greatest amount of
hand labour are the most useful—quite an untenable view.</p>

<p>A demonstration of a somewhat similar character has been
attempted by the Hedonistic school. They have shown how free
competition always tends to direct production into such channels as
will result in maximum utility, or, in other words, that it affords the
best method of satisfying the actual demands of the market. But
they have been very careful to note that social utility and ophelimity
are two very different expressions that must never be confused,
and that they have failed to find any scientific test of social utility.</p>

<p>Smith’s argument is unsatisfactory, and its foundation untrustworthy.
We do not forget that his optimism is based not so
much upon this specious demonstration as upon the great number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of observations which he had occasion to make in the course of his
work. This idea of a harmony between private interest and the
general well-being of society was not put forward as a rigidly demonstrable
<i>a priori</i> theory, open to no exceptions. It was rather a
general view of the whole position—the conclusion drawn from
repeated observations, the <i>résumé</i> of a detailed inquiry which
had covered every corner of the economic field. A particular process
of reasoning may have helped to confirm this conclusion, but the
reasoning itself was largely based upon experience, the universal
experience of history. It was the study of this experience that led
to the discovery of a “vital” principle of health and progress in the
“body social.” Smith would have been the first to oppose the
incorporation of his belief in any dogma. He was content to say
that “most frequently” and in a “majority of cases” general
interest <i>was</i> satisfied by the spontaneous action of private interest.
He was also the first to point out instances—in the case of merchants
and manufacturers, for example—where the particular and the
general interest came into conflict. We might cite many characteristic
passages in which he takes pains to qualify his optimism.</p>

<p>Absolute his optimism was not, neither was it universal. In fact,
it would not be difficult to prove that it was never intended to apply
to anything other than production. Nowhere does the great Scotch
economist pretend that the present distribution of wealth is the justest
possible—a trait that distinguishes him from the optimists of Bastiat’s
school. His optimism deserted him when he reached that portion of
his subject. On the contrary, he showed that landed proprietors as
well as capitalists “love to reap where they have not sown,” that inequalities
in social position give masters an advantage in bargaining
with their men.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> In more than one passage he speaks of interest and
rent as deductions from the produce of labour.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Smith, indeed,
might well be regarded as a forerunner of socialism. There is no
difficulty in believing, so far as the experience of old countries goes,
that “rent and profit eat up wages and the two superior orders of
people oppress the inferior one.”<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>It is especially important that we should make a note of the
opinions of those people who think that Smith intended his optimism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to extend to distribution as well as to production. As a matter
of fact he was too level-headed to entertain any such idea. Even
Say himself in the last edition of his <i>Treatise</i> expresses some doubts
as to the equity of the present system of distribution.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Smith
was not really concerned with the question at all. It is only at a
much later date, when the socialists had demonstrated the importance
of the problem, that we hear of this belief in the beneficence of
economic institutions. It really represents a reaction against the
socialistic teaching and an attempt at a justification of the present
methods of distribution.</p>

<p>We must beware of confusing Smith’s optimism with that of
modern Hedonism, or of identifying it with Bastiat’s answer to the
socialists. It lacks the scientific precision of the one and has none
of the apologetic tone of the other. It is little more than a reflection
prompted by the too naïve confidence of the eighteenth century in
the bounty of “nature,” and an expression of profound conviction
rather than the conclusion of a logical argument.</p>

<h4 id="heading10">III: ECONOMIC LIBERTY AND
INTERNATIONAL TRADE</h4>

<p>The practical conclusion to which naturalism leads and to which
Smith’s optimism points is economic liberty. So naturally does it
proceed from what we have just said that the reader finds himself
quite prepared for Smith’s celebrated phrases: “All systems either
of preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus completely taken
away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes
itself of its own accord. Every man, as long as he does not violate
the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest
his own way, and to bring both his industry and capital into competition
with those of any other man, or order of men.” As to
the Government, or “sovereign,” as Smith calls him, “he is completely
discharged from a duty, in the attempting to perform which
he must always be exposed to innumerable delusions, and for the
proper performance of which no human wisdom or knowledge
could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry
of private people, and of directing it towards the employments
most suitable to the interests of the society.”</p>

<p>Smith, following the Physiocrats, but in a more comprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and scientific fashion, finds himself driven to the same conclusion,
namely, the wisdom of non-intervention by the State in matters
economic.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>But here, as elsewhere in his work, the sense of the positive and
the concrete, so remarkable in Smith, prevents his being content
with a general demonstration. He is not satisfied with proving the
inefficiency of intervention as compared with the efficiency of those
institutions which are spontaneously created by society itself, but
he attempts to show that the State, by its very nature, is unfitted
for economic functions. His arguments have been the arsenal from
which the opponents of State intervention have been supplied with
ammunition ever since.</p>

<p>Let us briefly recall them.</p>

<p>“No two characters seem more inconsistent than those of trader
and sovereign.”<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Governments are “always, and without any
exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the society.”<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The reasons for
this are numerous. In the first place, they employ money which has
been gained by others, and one is always more prodigal of the wealth
of others than of one’s own. Moreover, the Government is too far
removed from the centres of particular industries to give them that
minute attention which they deserve if they are going to prosper.
“The attention of the sovereign can be at best but a very general and
vague consideration of what is likely to contribute to the better
cultivation of the greater part of his dominions. The attention of
the landlord is a particular and minute consideration of what is
likely to be the most advantageous application of every inch of
ground upon his estate.”<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>This necessity for a thorough cultivation of the soil and for the
best employment of capital, for direct and careful superintendence,
is an idea to which he continually reverts. He regrets, among
other things, that the growth of public debts causes a portion of the
land and the national capital to pass into the hands of fund-holders,
who are doubtless interested in the good administration of a country,
but “are not interested in the good condition of any particular portion
of land, or in the good management of any particular portion
of capital stock.”<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, the State is an inefficient administrator because its agents
are negligent and thriftless, not being directly interested in administration,
but paid out of public funds. Should the administration
of the land pass into the hands of the State he exclaims that not a
fourth of the present produce would ever be raised, because of “the
negligent, expensive, and oppressive management of his factors and
agents.”<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> On the contrary, he proposes that the remainder of the
common land should be distributed among individuals. On this
point European Governments have followed his advice somewhat
too closely.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> For the same reason—the necessity for stimulating
personal interest wherever possible—he commends, instead of a
fixed salary for public officers, payment by those who benefit by
their services, such payment in every case to be in strict proportion
to the zeal and activity displayed. This was to apply, for example,
to judges and professors.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>State administration is accordingly a <i>pis aller</i>, and intervention
ought to be strictly limited to those cases in which individual action
is impossible. Smith recognises three functions only which the State
can perform, namely the administration of justice, defence, “and,
thirdly, the duty of erecting and maintaining certain public works and
certain public institutions, which it can never be for the interest
of any individual, or small number of individuals, to erect and
maintain; because the profit could never repay the expence to any
individual or small number of individuals, though it may frequently
do much more than repay it to a great society.”<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>We must beware, however, lest we exaggerate this point.
Although Smith, in the majority of cases, preferred individual action,
we must not conclude from this that he had unlimited confidence in
individuals. Smith’s individualism was of a particular kind. It
was not a mere blind preference for every private enterprise, for he
knew that industry frequently falls a prey to the spirit of monopoly.
“People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment
and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the
public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In order that a
private enterprise may be useful for the community two conditions
are necessary. The <i>entrepreneur</i> must be: (1) actuated by personal
interest; (2) his actions must by means of competition be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
within the limits of justice. Should either of these two conditions
be wanting, the public would run the risk of losing as much by
private as they would by State enterprise.</p>

<p>Thus Smith throughout remains very hostile to certain collective
enterprises of a private nature, such as joint-stock companies,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
because of the absence of personal interest. The only exceptions
which he would tolerate are banks, insurance companies, and companies
formed for the construction or maintenance of canals or for
supplying great towns with water, for the management of such
undertakings can easily be reduced to a kind of routine, “or to such
a uniformity of method as admits of little or no variation.”<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>His opposition to every kind of monopoly granted either to an
individual or to a company is even more pronounced. A whole
chapter is devoted to an attack upon the great trading companies
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which were created
with a view to the development of colonial trade, and of which the
East India Company was the most famous.</p>

<p>One other observation remains to be made. Non-intervention
for Smith was a general principle, and not an absolute rule. He was
no doctrinaire, and he never forgot that to every rule there are some
exceptions. An interesting list could be made, giving all the cases
in which, according to Smith, the legitimacy of State intervention
was indisputable—legal limitation of interest,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> State administration
of the post-office, compulsory elementary education, State examinations
as a condition of entry into the liberal professions or to
any post of confidence whatever, bank-notes of a minimum value
of £5, etc.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> In a characteristic phrase he gave expression to his
feeling on the question of restricting the liberty of banks. “Such
regulations may, no doubt, be considered as in some respects
a violation of natural liberty. But those exertions of the natural
liberty of a few individuals, which might endanger the security of
the whole of society, are, and ought to be, restrained by the laws
of all governments; of the most free, as well as of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
despotical.”<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Despite these reservations it is still very evident that
the whole of Smith’s work is a plea for the economic freedom of the
individual. It is an eloquent appeal against the Mercantilist policy
and a violent attack upon every economic system inspired by it.</p>

<p>On this point there is absolute agreement between the work done
by Smith in England and that carried on at the same time by the
Physiocrats in France. Both in foreign and domestic trade producers,
merchants, and workmen were hemmed in by a network of
restrictions either inherited from the traditions of the Middle Ages
or imposed by powerful party interests and upheld by false economic
theories. The corporations still existed in the towns; although their
regulations could not be applied to industries born after the passing
of Elizabeth’s famous law concerning apprenticeship. The Colbertian
system, with its mob of officials entrusted with the task of superintending
the processes of production, of examining the weight, the
length, and the quality of the material employed, was still a grievance
with the woollen manufacturers.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The fixing of the duration of
apprenticeship at seven years, the limitation of the number of
apprentices in the principal industries, the obstacles put in the way
of the mobility of labour by the Poor Law and by the series of
statutes passed since the reign of Elizabeth, fettered the movement
of labour and the useful employment of capital. Smith opposed
these measures with the whole of his energy. England, unlike
France, had fortunately escaped internal restrictions upon trade, but
the restraints placed upon foreign trade still kept England and
Ireland commercially separated. These checks upon foreign trade
proved as irksome in England as they did everywhere else. Manufactured
goods from foreign countries were heavily taxed or were
prohibited entrance altogether. Certain natural products, <i>e.g.</i> French
wine, were similarly handicapped; the importation of a number of
commodities necessary for national industry was banned; a narrow
and oppressive policy regarded the colonies as the natural purveyors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of raw materials for the mother-country and the willing buyers of its
manufactured goods. Against all this mass of regulations, destined,
it was thought, to secure the supremacy of England among other
commercial nations, Smith directed his most spirited onslaughts.
The fourth book of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> is an eloquent and vigorous
attack upon Mercantilism, admirable alike for the precision and the
extent of its learning. It was this section of his work that interested
his contemporaries most. For us it would have been the least
interesting but for its theory of international trade and its criticism
of Protection in general. On this account, however, it is of considerable
importance in the study of economic doctrines.</p>

<p>In the struggle for Free Trade, as on other points, Smith was
forestalled by the Physiocrats. But again has he shown himself
superior in the breadth of his outlook. Physiocratic Liberalism was
the result of their interest in agriculture, foreign trade being of quite
secondary importance. Smith, on the other hand, considered foreign
trade in itself advantageous, provided it began at the right moment
and developed spontaneously.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Although his point of view is far
superior to that of the Physiocrats, even Smith failed to give us a
satisfactory theory. It was reserved for Ricardo and his successors,
particularly John Stuart Mill, to find a solid scientific basis for the
theory of international trade. The doctrine of the Scotch economist
is somewhat lame. But the hesitancy of a great writer is often
interesting, and some of his arguments deserve to be recalled.</p>

<p>Already in our review of his theory of money we have become
familiar with Smith’s criticism of the balance of trade theory. But
the balance of trade theory is not the whole of Protection, and we
find in Smith something more than its mere refutation. In the
first place, we have a criticism of Protectionism in general considered
in its Mercantilistic aspect, followed by an attempt to demonstrate
the positive advantages of international commerce.</p>

<p>The first criticism that he offers might be summed up in the
well-known phrase: “Industry is limited by capital.” “The general
industry of the society can never exceed what the capital of the
society can employ.” But Protection, perhaps, increases the quantity
of capital? No, “for it can only divert a part of it into a direction
into which it might not otherwise have gone.” But the direction
spontaneously given to their capital by individuals is the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
favourable to a country’s industry. Has not Smith demonstrated
this already? Protection, consequently, is not merely useless; it
may even prove injurious.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>The argument does not appear decisive, especially when we recall
the criticism of Smith’s optimism given above. To borrow an
expression of M. Pareto, it is the maximum of ophelimity and not
the maximum of utility that is realised by the capitalists under the
action of personal interest.</p>

<p>A second and a more striking argument shows the absurdity of
manufacturing a commodity in this country at a great expense,
when a similar commodity might be supplied by a foreign country
at less cost. “It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family,
never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to
make than to buy.… What is prudence in the conduct of every
private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
It is foolish to grow grapes in hothouses in Scotland when better
and cheaper can be got from Portugal or France. Everybody is
convinced of that. But a similar stupidity prevails when we are
hindered by tariffs from profiting by the natural advantages which
foreign nations possess as compared with ourselves. All “the
mean rapacity and the monopolizing spirit of merchants and manufacturers”<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
was necessary to blind men to their true interests
on this point. According to Smith, there exists a natural distribution
of products among various countries, resulting in an advantage
to all of them. It is Protection that hinders our sharing in the
advantages. This is the principle known as the “territorial division
of labour.”</p>

<p>But the argument is inconclusive, for capital and labour do not
circulate from one nation to another in the same way as they do
within a country. The distribution of industry among the various
nations is regulated, not by absolute cost of production, but by
relative cost of production. The credit of having shown this belongs
to Ricardo.</p>

<p>Smith’s demonstration of the inconveniences of Protection is
incomplete, and we feel the incompleteness all the more when he
attempts to prove the advantages of international trade.</p>

<p>The real and decisive argument in favour of free exchange turns
upon a consideration of the consumer’s interests. Increased
utilities placed at his disposal mark the superiority of free exchange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
or as John Stuart Mill puts it, “the only direct advantage of foreign
commerce consists in the imports.”<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> With Smith this is the point
of view developed least of all. True, he wrote that “consumption
is the sole end and purpose of all production. But, in the
mercantile system, the interest of the consumer is almost constantly
sacrificed to that of the producer.”<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> This criticism, however, was
placed at the end of his examination of the Mercantilist system in
chap. 8 of Book IV. It is not found in the first edition of the
work, and was only added in the third.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>It is the point of view of the producer that Smith invariably adopts
when attempting to illustrate the advantages of international trade.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Just now foreign trade seemed to afford a means of disposing of
a country’s surplus products, and this extension of the market, it
was argued, would lead to further division of labour and increased
productivity.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> But one is led to ask why, instead of producing the
superfluous goods which it must export, it does not produce those
things which it is obliged to import.</p>

<p>Smith, being now desirous of showing that international trade
necessarily benefits both countries, bases his argument upon the
fact that the merchants in both countries must make a profit—<i>i.e.</i> get
an additional exchange value, which must be added to the others.
To this Ricardo justly replied that the profits of a merchant do not
necessarily increase the sum of utilities possessed by any country.</p>

<p>Here again, in striking contrast with the attitude of the Physiocrats,
Smith, despite himself, has championed his own adversaries.
As yet he is not sufficiently rid of Mercantilist prejudice not to be
concerned with the welfare of the producer, and in his great work
we find excellent argument and debatable points of view placed side
by side. It does not appear that he himself realised this incompatibility.
An irresistible tide was sweeping everybody before it
in the direction of a more liberal policy. It proved too powerful for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
his contemporaries, who were not concerned to give a careful
consideration to every part of his thesis. Enough that they found
in him an ardent champion of an attractive cause.</p>

<p>We have already noticed more than once the hesitation which
Smith displays when he comes to apply his principle, and we must
again refer to it in this connection.</p>

<p>Theoretically a champion of absolutely free exchange, he mitigates
his belief in practice, and mentions an exception to his policy
which seemed to him a mere matter of common sense. “To expect,
indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in
Great Britain, is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia
should ever be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the
public, but what is more unconquerable, the private interests of
many individuals, irresistibly oppose it.”<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Facts have belied this
prophecy, like many others. England of the nineteenth century
succeeded in realising this Utopia of free exchange—almost to
perfection.</p>

<p>Without any illusion as to the future, his condemnation of the
past was not altogether unqualified. He justified some of the acts
that were inspired by Mercantilism. “The act of navigation<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> is
not favourable to foreign commerce,” said he; “as defence,
however, is of much more importance than opulence, the act of
navigation is, perhaps, the wisest of all the commercial regulations
of England.”<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> In another instance he justifies an import duty
where a tax is levied upon goods similar to those imported. Here
an import duty merely restores that normal state of competition
which was upset by the imposition of the Excise. Retaliation as
a means of securing the abolition of foreign duties is not altogether
under his ban.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> And he finally admits that liberty is best introduced
gradually into those countries in which industry has long enjoyed
Protection or where a great number of men are employed.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>His practical conclusion is somewhat as follows: Instead of
innumerable taxes which hinder importation and hamper production,
England ought to content herself with the establishment of a certain
number of taxes of a purely fiscal character, placed upon commodities
such as wine, alcohol, sugar, tobacco, cocoa. Such a
system, though perfectly consonant with a great deal of free exchange,
would yield abundant revenue to the Treasury, and would afford
ample compensation for the losses resulting from the introduction of
Free Trade.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>England has followed his advice, and her financial system is
to-day founded on these bases. Few economists can boast of such
a complete realisation of their projects.</p>

<h4 id="heading11">IV: THE INFLUENCE OF SMITH’S THOUGHT
AND ITS DIFFUSION. J. B. SAY</h4>

<p>The eighteenth century was essentially a century of levelling down.
In Smith’s conception of the economic world we have an excellent
example of this. Its chief charm lies in the simplicity of its outlines,
and this doubtless accounted for his influence among his contemporaries.
The system of natural liberty towards which both their
political and philosophical aspirations seemed to point were here
deduced from, and supported by, evidence taken direct from a study
of human nature—evidence, moreover, that seemed to tally so well
with known facts that doubt was out of the question. Smith’s work
still retains its irresistible charm. Even if his ideas are some day
shown to be untenable—a contingency we cannot well imagine—his
book will remain as a permanent monument of one of the most
important epochs in economic thought. It must still be considered
the most successful attempt made at embracing within a single
purview the infinite diversity of the economic world.</p>

<p>But its simplicity also constituted its weakness. To attain this
simplicity more than one important fact that refused to fit in with
the system had to remain in the background. The evidence employed
was also frequently incomplete. None of the special themes—price,
wages, profits, and rent, the theory of international trade or of
capital—which occupy the greater portion of the work, but has
been in some way corrected, disputed, or replaced. But the structure
loses stability if some of the corner-stones are removed. And new
points of view have appeared of which Smith did not take sufficient
account. Instead of the pleasant impression of simplicity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
security which a perusal of Smith’s work gave to the economists of
the early nineteenth century, there has been gradually substituted
by his successors a conviction of the growing complexity of
economic phenomena.</p>

<p>To pass a criticism on the labours of Adam Smith would be to
review the economic doctrines of the nineteenth century. That is
the best eulogy one can bestow upon his work. The economic ideas
of a whole century were, so to speak, in solution in his writings.
Friends and foes have alike taken him as their starting-point. The
former have developed, extended, and corrected his work. The latter
have subjected his principal theories to harsh criticism at every point.
All with tacit accord admit that political economy commenced
with him. As Garnier, his French translator, put it, “he wrought
a complete revolution in the science.”<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> To-day, even although the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i> may no longer appear to us as a truly scientific
treatise on political economy, certain of its fundamental ideas remain
incontestable. The theory of money, the importance of division of
labour, the fundamental character of spontaneous economic institutions,
the constant operation of personal interest in economic life,
liberty as the basis of rational political economy—all these appear
to us as definite acquisitions to the science.</p>

<p>The imperfections of the work will be naturally demonstrated
in the chapters which follow. In order to complete our exposition
of Smith’s doctrines it only remains to show how they were
diffused.</p>

<p>The rapid spread of his ideas throughout Europe and their
incontestable supremacy remains one of the most curious phenomena
in the history of ideas. Smith persuaded his own generation and
governed the next.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> History affords us some clue. To attribute
it solely to the influence of his book is sheer exaggeration. A great
deal must be set to the credit of circumstances more or less fortuitous.</p>

<p>M. Mantoux remarks with much justice that “it was the American
War rather than Smith’s writings which demonstrated the decay of
the ancient political economy and compassed its ruin. The War
of Independence proved two things: (1) The danger lurking in
a colonial system which could goad the most prosperous colonies
to revolt; (2) the uselessness of a protective tariff, for on the very
morrow of the war English trade with the American colonies was
more flourishing than ever before. “The loss of the American
colonies to England was really a gain to her.” So wrote Say in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
1803, and he adds: “This is a fact that I have nowhere seen disputed.”<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
To the American War other causes must be added:
(1) The urgent need for markets felt by English merchants at the
close of the Napoleonic wars; they were already abundantly
supplied with excellent machinery. (2) Coupled with this was a
growing belief that a high price of corn as the result of agricultural
protection increased the cost of hand labour. These two reasons
were enough to create a desire for a general lowering of the customs
duties.</p>

<p>Subsequent events have justified Smith’s attitude on the question
of foreign trade. In the matter of domestic trade he has been less
fortunate.</p>

<p>The French Revolution, which owed its economic measures to
the Physiocrats, gave a powerful impulse to the principle of liberty.
The influence of the movement was patent enough on the Continent.
Even in England, where this influence was least felt; everybody was
in favour of <i>laissez-faire</i>. Pitt became anxious to free Ireland from
its antiquated system of prohibitions, and he succeeded in doing
this by his Act of Union of 1800. The regulations laid down by the
Elizabethan Statute of Apprentices, with its limitation of the hours
of work and the fixing of wages by justices of the peace, became more
and more irksome as industry developed. Every historian of the
Industrial Revolution has described the struggle between workers
and masters and shown how the former clung in despair to the old
legislative measures as their only safeguard against a too rapid
change, while the latter refused to be constrained either in the
choice of workmen or the methods of their work.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> They wished to
pay only the wages that suited them and to use their machines as
long as possible. These repeated attacks rendered the old Statute
of Apprentices useless, and Parliament abolished its regulations one
after another, so that by 1814 all traces of it were for ever effaced
from the Statute Book.</p>

<p>But Smith did not foresee these things. He did not write with
a view to pleasing either merchants or manufacturers. On the
contrary, he was never weary of denouncing their monopolistic
tendencies. But by the force of circumstances manufacturers
and merchants became his best allies. His book supplied them
with arguments, and it was his authority that they always
invoked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>His authority never ceased growing. As soon as the <i>Wealth of
Nations</i> appeared, men like Hume, and Gibbon, the historian,
expressed to Smith or to his friends their admiration of the new
work. In the following year the Prime Minister, Lord North,
borrowed from him the idea of levying two new taxes—the tax on
malt and the tax on inhabited houses. Smith was yet to make
an even more illustrious convert in the person of Pitt. Pitt was a
student when the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> appeared, but he always declared
himself a disciple of Smith, and as soon as he became a Minister he
strove to realise his ideas. It was he who signed the first Free
Trade treaty with France—the Treaty of Eden, 1786.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> When
Smith came to London in 1787, Pitt met him more than once
and consulted him on financial matters. The story is told that
after one of these conversations Smith exclaimed: “What an
extraordinary person Pitt is! He understands my ideas better than
myself.”</p>

<p>While Smith made converts of the most prominent men of his
time, his book gradually reached the public. Four editions in
addition to the first appeared during the author’s lifetime.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The
third, in 1784, presents important differences in the way of additions
and corrections as compared with the first. From the date of his
death in 1790 to the end of the century three other editions were
published.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Similar success attended the appearance of the work on the Continent.
In France he was already known through his <i>Theory of Moral
Sentiments</i>. The first mention of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> in France
appears in the <i>Journal des Savants</i> in the month of February, 1777.
Here, after a brief description of the merits of the work, the critic
gives expression to the following curious opinion: “Some of our
men of letters who have read it have come to the conclusion that it
is not a book that can be translated into our language. They point
out, among other reasons, that no one would be willing to bear the
expense of publishing because of the uncertain return, and a book-seller
least of all. They are bound to admit, however, that the work
is full of suggestions and of advice that is useful as well as curious,
and might prove of benefit to statesmen.” In reality, despite the
opinion of those men of letters, several translations of the work
did appear in France, as well as elsewhere in Europe. In little more
than twenty years, between 1779 and 1802, four translations had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
appeared. This in itself affords sufficient proof of the interest which
the book had aroused.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Few works have enjoyed such complete and universal success.
But despite admiration the ideas did not spread very rapidly.
Faults of composition have been burdened with the responsibility
for this, and it is a reproach that has clung to the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>
from the first. Its organic unity is very pronounced, but Smith
does not seem to have taken the trouble to give it even the semblance
of outward unity. To discover its unity requires a real effort of
thought. Smith whimsically regarded it as a mere discourse, and
the reading occasionally gives the impression of conversation. The
general formulæ which summarise or recapitulate his ideas are
indifferently found either in the middle or at the end of a chapter,
just as they arose. They represent the conclusions from what
preceded as they flashed across his mind. On the other hand, a
consideration of such a question as money is scattered throughout
the whole work, being discussed on no less than ten different occasions.
As early as April 1, 1776, Hume had expressed to Smith
some doubts as to the popularity of the book, seeing that its reading
demanded considerable attention. Sartorius in 1794 attributed to
this difficulty the slow progress made by Smith’s ideas in Germany.
Germain Garnier, the French translator, gave an outline of the
book in order to assist his readers. It was generally agreed that
the work was a striking one, but badly composed and difficult to
penetrate owing to the confused and equivocal character of some
of the paragraphs. When Say referred to it as “a chaotic collection
of just ideas thrown indiscriminately among a number of positive
truths,”<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> he expressed the opinion of all who had read it.</p>

<p>But a complete triumph, so far as the Continent at least was
concerned, had to be the work of an interpreter. Such an interpreter
must fuse all these ideas into a coherent body of doctrines,
leaving useless digressions aside.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> This was the task that fell into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
hands of J. B. Say. Among his merits (and it is not the only one) is
that of popularising the ideas of the great Scotch economist on the
Continent, and of giving to the ideas a somewhat classical appearance.
The task of discrediting the first French school of economists and of
facilitating the expansion of English political economy fell, curiously
enough, to the hands of a Frenchman.</p>

<p>J. B. Say was twenty-three years of age in 1789.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> At that time
he was Clavières’ secretary. Clavières became Minister of Finance
in 1792, but at this period he was manager of an assurance company,
and was already a disciple of Smith. Say came across some stray
pages of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, and sent for a copy of the book.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
The impression it made upon him was profound. “When we read this
work,” he writes, “we feel that previous to Smith there was no
such thing as political economy.” Fourteen years afterwards, in
1803, appeared <i>Le Traité d’Économie politique</i>. The book met with
immediate success, and a second edition would have appeared had
not the First Consul interdicted it. Say had refused to support the
Consul’s financial recommendations, and the writer, in addition to
having his book proscribed, found himself banished from the Tribunate.
Say waited until 1814 before republishing it. New editions rapidly
followed, in 1817, 1819, and 1826. The treatise was translated into
several languages. Say’s authority gradually extended itself; his
reputation became European; and by these means the ideas of
Adam Smith, clarified and logically arranged in the form of general
principles from which conclusions could be easily deduced, gradually
captivated the more enlightened section of public opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>It would, however, be unjust to regard Say as a mere populariser
of Smith’s ideas. With praiseworthy modesty, he has never
attempted to conceal all that he owed to the master. The master’s
name is mentioned in almost every line, but he never remains
content with a mere repetition of his ideas. These are carefully
reconsidered and reviewed with discrimination. He develops some
of them and emphasises others. Amid the devious paths pursued
by Smith, the French economist chooses that which most directly
leads to the desired end. This path is so clearly outlined for his
successors that “wayfaring men, though fools, could not err therein.”
In a sense he may be said to have filtered the ideas of the master, or
to have toned his doctrines with the proper tints. He thus imparted
to French political economy its distinctive character as distinguished
from English political economy, to which at about the same time
Malthus and Ricardo were to give an entirely new orientation.
What interests us more than his borrowing is the personal share
which he has in the work, an estimate of which we must now
attempt.</p>

<p>(1) In the first place, Say succeeded in overthrowing the work of
the Physiocrats.</p>

<p>The work of demolition was not altogether useless. In France
there were many who still clung to the “sect.” Even Germain
Garnier, Smith’s translator, considered the arguments of the Physiocrats
theoretically irrefutable. The superiority of the Scotch economist
was entirely in the realm of practice.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> “We may,” says
he, “reject the <i>Economistes’</i> theory [meaning the Physiocrats’]
because it is less useful, although it is not altogether erroneous.”
Smith himself, as we know, was never quite rid of this idea, for he
recognised a special productiveness of land as a result of the co-operation
of nature, and doctors, judges, advocates, and artists were
regarded as unproductive. But Say’s admission was the last straw.
Not in agriculture alone, but everywhere, “nature is forced to work
along with man,”<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and by the funds of nature was to be understood
in future all the help that a nation draws directly from nature, be
it the force of wind or rush of water.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> As to the doctors, lawyers,
etc., how are we to prove that they take no part in production?
Garnier had already protested against their exclusion. Such services
must no doubt be classed as immaterial products, but products none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the less, seeing that they possess exchange value and are the outcome<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
of the co-operation of capital and industry. In other respects
also—<i>e.g.</i>, in the pleasure and utility which they yield—services
are not very unlike commodities. Say’s doctrine meets with some
opposition on this point, for the English economists were unwilling
to consider a simple service as wealth because of its unendurable
character, and the consequent fact that it could not be considered
as adding to the aggregate amount of capital. But he soon wins
over the majority of writers.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Finally Say, like Condillac, discovered
a decisive argument against Physiocracy in the fact that the production
of material objects does not imply their creation. Man never
can create, but must be content with mere transformation of matter.
Production is merely a creation of utilities, a furthering of that
capacity of responding to our needs and of satisfying our wants
which is possessed by commodities; and all work is productive which
achieves this result, whether it be industry, commerce, or agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
The Physiocratic distinction falls to the ground, and Say
refutes what Smith, owing to his intimacy with his adversaries,
had failed to disprove.</p>

<p>(2) On another point Say carries forward Smith’s ideas, although
at the same time superseding them. He subjects the whole conception
of political economy and the <i>rôle</i> of the economist to a most
thorough examination.</p>

<p>We have already noticed that the conception of the “natural
order” underwent considerable modification during the period which
intervened between the writings of the Physiocrats and the appearance
of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>. The Physiocrats regarded the “order”
as one that was to be realised, and the science of political economy
as essentially normative. For Smith it was a self-realising order.
This spontaneity of the economic world is analogous to the vitality
of the human body, and is capable of triumphing over the artificial
barriers which Governments may erect against its progress. Practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
political economy is based upon a knowledge of the economic constitution
of society, and its sole aim is to give advice to statesmen.
According to Say, this definition concedes too much to practice.
Political economy, as he thinks, is just the science of this “spontaneous
economic constitution,” or, as he puts it in 1814, it is a study
of the laws which govern wealth.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> It is, as the title of his book
suggests, simply an exposition of the production, distribution, and
consumption of wealth. It must be distinguished from politics,
with which it has been too frequently confused, and also from
statistics, which is a simple description of particular facts and not a
science of co-ordinate principles at all.</p>

<p>Political economy in Say’s hands became a purely theoretical
and descriptive science. The <i>rôle</i> of the economist, like that of the
savant, is not to give advice, but simply to observe, to analyse, and
to describe. “He must be content to remain an impartial spectator,”
he writes to Malthus in 1820. “What we owe to the public is to
tell them how and why such and such a fact is the consequence of
another. Whether the conclusion be welcomed or rejected, it is
enough that the economist should have demonstrated its cause; but
he must give no advice.”<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>In this way Say broke with the long tradition which, stretching
from the days of the Canonists and the Cameralists to those of the
Mercantilists and the Physiocrats, had treated political economy as
a practical art and a guide for statesmen and administrators. Smith
had already tried to approach economic phenomena as a scientist, but
there was always something of the reformer in his attitude. Say’s
only desire was to be a mere student; the healing art had no attraction
for him, and so he inaugurates the true scientific method. He,
moreover, instituted a comparison between this science and physics
rather than between it and natural history, and in this respect also
he differed from Smith, for whom the social body was essentially a
living thing. Without actually employing the term “social physics,”
he continually suggests it by his repeated comparison with Newtonian
physics. The principles of the science, like the laws of physics, are
not the work of men. They are derived from the very nature of
things. They are not established; they are discovered. They
govern even legislators and princes, and one never violates them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
impunity.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Like the laws of gravity, they are not confined within
the frontiers of any one country, and the limits of State administration,
which are all-important for the student of politics, are mere
accidents for the economist.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Political economy is accordingly
based on the model of an exact science, with laws that are universal.
Like physics, it is not so much concerned with the accumulation of
particular facts as with the formulation of a few general principles
from which a chain of consequences of greater or smaller length may
be drawn according to circumstances.</p>

<p>A delight in uniformity,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> love of universality, and contempt for
isolated facts, these are the marks of the savant. But the same
qualities in men of less breadth of view may easily become deformed
and result in faults of indifference or of dogmatism, or even contempt
for all facts. And are these very faults not produced by
the stress which he lays upon these principles? Was not political
economy placed in a vulnerable position for the attacks of Sismondi,
of List, of the Historical school, and of the Christian Socialists
by this very work of Say? In his radical separation of politics
and economics, in avoiding the “practical” leanings of Adam
Smith, he has succeeded in giving the science a greater degree of
harmony. But it also acquired a certain frigidity which his less
gifted successors have mistaken for banality or crudity. Rightly
or wrongly, the responsibility is ascribed to Say.</p>

<p>(3) We have just seen the influence which the progress of the
physical sciences had upon Say’s conception of political economy;
but he was also much influenced by the progress of industry. Between
1776, the date of the appearance of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, and the
year 1803, when Say’s treatise appeared, the Industrial Revolution
had taken place. This is a fact of considerable importance for the
history of economic ideas.</p>

<p>When Say visited England a little before 1789, he found machine
production already in full swing there. In France at the same date
manufactures were only just beginning. They increased rapidly
under the Empire, and the progress after 1815 became enormous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Chaptal in his work <i>De l’Industrie française</i> reckons that in 1819
there were 220 factories in existence, with 922,200 spindles consuming
13 million kilograms of raw cotton. This, however, only represented
a fifth of the English production, which twenty years later
was quadrupled. Other industries were developing in a similar
way. Everybody was convinced that the future must be along those
lines—an indefinite future it is true, but it was to be one of wealth,
work, and well-being. The rising generation was intoxicated at
the prospect. The most eloquent exposition of this debauchery will
be found in Saint-Simonism.</p>

<p>Say did not escape the infection. While Smith gives agriculture
the premier place, Say accords the laurels to manufactures. For
many years industrial problems had been predominant in political
economy, and the first official course of lectures given by Say himself
at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers was entitled “A Course
of Lectures on Industrial Economy.”</p>

<p>In that hierarchy of activities which Smith had drawn up
according to the varying degree of utility each possessed for the
nation, Smith had placed agriculture first. Say preserved the order,
but placed alongside of agriculture “all capital employed in utilising
any of the productive forces of nature. An ingenious machine
may produce more than the equivalent of the interest on the capital
it has cost to produce, and society enjoys the benefit in lower prices.”<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
This sentence is not found in the edition of 1803, and appears only
in the second edition. Say in the meantime had been managing
his factory at Auchy-les-Hesdins, and he had profited by his experience.
This question of machinery, which was merely touched
on by Smith in a short passage, finds a larger place in every successive
edition of Say’s work. The general adoption of machinery by
manufacturers both in England and France frequently incited the
workers to riot. Say does not fail to demonstrate its advantages.
At first he admits that the Government might mitigate the resulting
evils by confining the employment of machinery at the outset
to certain districts where labour is scarce or is employed in other
branches of production.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> But by the beginning of the fifth edition
he changed his advice and declared that such intervention involved
interference with the inventor’s property,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> admitting only that the
Government might set up works of public utility in order to employ
those men who are thrown out of employment on account of the
introduction of machinery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The influence of these same circumstances must be accounted
responsible for the stress which is laid by Say upon the <i>rôle</i> of an
individual whom Smith had not even defined, but one who is henceforth
to remain an important personage in the economic world, namely,
the <i>entrepreneur</i>. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the
principal agent of economic progress was the industrious, active,
well-informed individual, either an ingenious inventor, a progressive
agriculturist, or an experienced business man. This type became
quite common in every country where mechanical production and
increasing markets became the rule. It is he rather than the
capitalist properly so called, the landed proprietor, or the workman,
who is “almost always passive,” who directs production and
superintends the distribution of wealth. “The power of industrial
<i>entrepreneurs</i> exercises a most notable influence upon the distribution
of wealth,” says Say. “In the same kind of industry one
<i>entrepreneur</i> who is judicious, active, methodical, and willing makes
his fortune, while another who is devoid of these qualities or who
meets with very different circumstances would be ruined.”<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Is it
not the master spinner of Auchy-les-Hesdins who is speaking here?
We are easily convinced of this if we compare the edition of
1803 with that of 1814, and we can trace the gradual growth and
development of this conception with every successive edition of
the work.</p>

<p>Say’s classic exposition of the mechanism of distribution is based
upon this very admirable conception, which is altogether superior to
that of Smith or the Physiocrats. The <i>entrepreneur</i> serves as the
pivot of the whole system. The following may be regarded as an
outline of his treatment.</p>

<p>Men, capital, and labour furnish what Say refers to as productive
services. These services, when brought to market, are given in
exchange for wages, interest, or rent. It is the <i>entrepreneur</i>, whether
merchant, manufacturer, or agriculturist, who requires them, and
it is he who combines them with a view to satisfying the demand
of consumers. “The <i>entrepreneurs</i>, accordingly, are mere intermediaries
who set up a claim for those productive services which
are necessary to satisfy the demand for certain products.” Accordingly
there arises a demand for productive services, and the demand
is “one of the factors determining the value of those services.”
“On the other hand, the agents of production, both men and things,
whether land, capital, or industrial employees, offer their services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in greater or less quantities according to various motives, and thus
constitute another factor which determines the value of these
same services.”<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> In this fashion the law of demand and supply
determines the price of services, the average rate of interest, and
rent. Thanks to the <i>entrepreneur</i>, the value produced is again
distributed among these “various productive services,” and the
various services allotted according to need among the industries.
This theory of distribution is in complete accordance with the
theory of exchange and production.</p>

<p>Say’s very simple scheme of distribution constitutes a real progress.
In the first place, it is much more exact than the Physiocrats’, who
conceived of exchange as taking place between classes only, and not
between individuals. It also enables us to distinguish the remuneration
of the capitalist from the earnings of the <i>entrepreneur</i>, which
were confounded by Adam Smith. The Scotch economist assumed
that the <i>entrepreneur</i> was very frequently a capitalist, and confused
the two functions, designating his total remuneration by the single
word “profit,” without ever distinguishing between net interest of
capital and profit properly so called. This regrettable confusion
was followed by other English authors, and remained in English
economic theory for a long time. Finally, Say’s theory has another
advantage. It gave to his French successors a clear scheme of
distribution which was wanting in Smith’s work, just at the time
when Ricardo was attempting to overcome the omission by outlining
a new theory of distribution. According to Ricardo, rent, by its very
nature and the laws which give rise to it, is opposed to other revenues,
and the rate of wages and of profits must be regarded as direct opposites,
so that the one can only increase if the other diminishes—an
attractive but erroneous theory, and one which led to endless discussion
among English economists, with the result that they abandoned
it altogether. Say, by showing this dependence, which
becomes quite clear if we regard wages and profits from the point
of view of demand for commodities, and by his demonstration
that rent is determined by the same general causes—viz. demand
and supply—as determine the exchange value of other productive
services, saved political economy in France from a similar disaster.
It was he, also, who furnished Walras with the first outlines of his
attractive conception of prices and economic equilibrium. This
explains why he never attached to the theory of rent the supreme
importance given to it by English economists. In this respect
he has been followed by the majority of French economists. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
other hand, and for a similar reason, he never went to the opposite
extreme of denying the existence of rent altogether by regarding it
merely as the revenue yielded by capital sunk in land. In this way
he avoided the error which Carey and Bastiat attempted to defend
at a later period.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>(4) So far it is Say’s brilliant power of logical reasoning that we
have admired. But has he contributed anything which is entirely
new to the science?</p>

<p>His theory of markets was for a long time considered first-class
work. “Products are given in exchange for products.” It
is a happy phrase, but it is not in truth very profound. It
simply gives expression to an idea that was quite familiar to the
Physiocrats and to Smith, namely, that money is but an intermediary
which is acquired only to be passed on and exchanged for
another product. “Once the exchange has been effected it is
immediately discovered that products pay for products.”<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Thus
goods constitute a demand for other goods, and the interest of a
country that produces much is that other countries should produce
at least as much. Say thought that the outcome of this would be
the advent of the true brotherhood of man. “The theory of markets
will change the whole policy of the world,” said he.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> He thought
that the greater part of the doctrine of Free Trade could be based
upon this principle. But to expect so much from such a vague, self-evident
formula was to hope for the impossible.</p>

<p>Still more interesting is the way in which he applied this “theory
of markets” to a study of over-production crises, and the light which
that sheds upon the nature of Say’s thought. Garnier had already
pointed out that a general congestion of markets was possible. As
crises multiplied this fear began to agitate the minds of a number of
thinkers. “Nothing can be more illogical,” writes Say. “The total
supply of products and the total demand for them must of necessity
be equal, for the total demand is nothing but the whole mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
commodities which have been produced: a general congestion
would consequently be an absurdity.”<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> It would simply mean a
general increase of wealth, and “wealth is none too plentiful among
nations, any more than it is among individuals.”<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> We may have an
inefficient application of the means of production, resulting in the
over-production of some one commodity or other—<i>i.e.</i> we may have
partial over-production.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Say wishes to emphasise the fact that
we need never fear general over-production, but that we may have
too much of some one product or other. He frequently gave
expression to this idea in the form of paradoxes. We might almost
be led to believe that he denies the existence of crises altogether in
the second edition of his work.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In reality he was very anxious to
admit their existence, but he wished to avoid everything that might
prove unfavourable to an extension of industry.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>He thought that crises were essentially transient, and declared
that individual liberty would be quite enough to prevent them. He
was extremely anxious to get rid of the vague terrors which had
haunted those people who feared that they would not be able to
consume all this wealth, of a Malthus who thought the existence of
the idle rich afforded a kind of safety-valve which prevented over-production,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
of a Sismondi who prayed for a slackening of the pace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of industrial progress and a checking of inventions. Such thoughts
arouse his indignation, especially, as he remarks, when it is remembered
that even among the most flourishing nations “seven-eighths
of the population are without a great number of products which would
be regarded as absolute necessities, not by a wealthy family, but even
by one of moderate means.”<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The inconvenience—and he is never
tired of repeating it—is not the result of over-production, but is
the effect of producing what is not exactly wanted.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Produce,
produce all that you can, and in the natural course of events a lowering
of prices will benefit even those who at first suffered from the
extension of industry.</p>

<p>In this once famous controversy between Say, Malthus, Sismondi,
and Ricardo (the latter sided with Say) we must not expect to find
a clear exposition of the causes of crises. Indeed, that is nowhere
to be found. All we have here is the expression of a sentiment
which is at bottom perfectly just, but one which Say wrongly
attempted to state in a scientific formula.</p>

<p>J. B. Say plays a by no means negligible part in the history of
doctrines. Foreign economists have not always recognised him.
Dühring, who is usually perspicacious, is very unjust to him when he
speaks of “the labour of dilution” to which Say devoted his energies.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
His want of insight frequently caused him to glide over problems
instead of attempting to fathom them, and his treatment of political
economy occasionally appears very superficial. Certain difficulties
are veiled with pure verbiage—a characteristic in which he is very
frequently imitated by Bastiat. Despite Say’s greater lucidity, it
is doubtful whether Smith’s obscurity of style is not, after all, more
stimulating for the mind. Notwithstanding all this, he was faithful
in his transmission of the ideas of the great Scotch economist into
French. Happily his knowledge of Turgot and Condillac enabled
him to rectify some of the more contestable opinions of his master,
and in this way he avoided many of the errors of his successors.
He has left his mark upon French political economy, and had the
English economists adopted his conception of the <i>entrepreneur</i> earlier,
instead of waiting until the appearance of Jevons, they would have
spared the science many useless discussions provoked by the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of a thinker who was certainly more profound but much less judicious
than Say, namely, David Ricardo.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III_THE_PESSIMISTS">CHAPTER III: THE PESSIMISTS</h3>

<p>A new point of view is presented to us by the economists of whom
we are now going to speak. Hitherto we have heard with admiration
of the discovery of new facts and of their beneficent effects both
upon nations and individuals. We are now to witness the enunciation
of new doctrines which cast a deepening shadow across the
radiant dawn of economics, giving it that strangely sinister aspect
which led Carlyle to dub it “the dismal science.”</p>

<p>Hence the term “Pessimists,” although no reproach is implied
in our use of that term. On the contrary, we shall have to show
that the theories of the school are often truer than those of the
Optimists, which we must study at a later stage of our survey. While
nominally subscribing to their predecessors’ doctrine concerning the
identity of individual and general interests, the many cogent reasons
which they have adduced against such belief warrants our classification.
The antagonism existing between proprietors and capitalists,
between capitalists and workmen, is a discovery of theirs. Instead
of the “natural” or “providential” laws that were to secure the
establishment of the “order” provided they were once thoroughly
understood and obeyed, they discovered the existence of other laws,
such as that of rent, which guaranteed a revenue for a minority of
idle proprietors—a revenue that was destined to grow as the direct
result of the people’s growing need; or the “law of diminishing returns,”
which sets a definite limit to the production of the necessaries
of life. That limit, they asserted, was already being approached,
and mankind had no prospect of bettering its lot save by the
voluntary limitation of its numbers. There was also the tendency
of profits to fall to a minimum—until it seemed as if the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
human industry would sooner or later be swallowed up by the
stagnant waters of the stationary State.</p>

<p>Lastly, they deserve to be classed as pessimists because of their
utter disbelief in the possibility of changing the course of these
inevitable laws either by legislative reform or by organised voluntary
effort. In short, they had no faith in what we call progress.</p>

<p>But we must never imagine that they considered themselves
pessimists or were classed as such by their contemporaries. This
verdict is posterity’s, and would have caused them no little surprise.
As for themselves, they seem to stand aloof from their systems with
an insouciance that is most disconcerting. The “present order of
things” possessed no disquieting features for them, and they never
doubted the wisdom of “Nature’s Lord.” They believed that
property had been put upon an immovable basis when they demonstrated
the extent of its denotation, and that the spirit of revolt had
been disarmed by impressing upon the poor a sense of responsibility
for their own miseries.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The best known representatives of the school are Malthus and
Ricardo. They claimed to be philanthropists and friends of the
people, and we have no reason to suspect their sincerity.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Their
contemporaries, also, far from being alarmed, received the new
political economy with the greatest enthusiasm. A warm welcome
was extended to its apostles by the best of English society,<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and
ladies of distinction contended with one another for the privilege
of popularising the abstract thoughts of Ricardo in newspaper
articles and popular tales.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither should we omit to pay them full homage for the eminent
services rendered to the science, and among these not the least
important was the antagonism which their theories aroused in the
minds of the working classes. Pessimists unwittingly often do
more for progress than optimists. To these two writers fell the task
of criticising economic doctrines and institutions, a task that has
been taken up by other writers in the course of the century, but
which seems as far from completion as ever. Karl Marx, another
critic, is intellectually a scion of the Ricardian family. It would
be a mistake to imagine that all their theories savour of pessimism,
but their reputation has always been more or less closely linked with
the gloomier aspect of their teaching.</p>

<h4 id="heading12">I: MALTHUS<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></h4>

<p>Malthus is best known for his “law of population.” That he was
a great economist, even apart from his study of that question, might
easily be proved by reference to his treatise on political economy,
or by a perusal of the many miscellaneous articles which he wrote
on various economic questions. A consideration of many of these
theories, notably the theory of rent, must be postponed until we
come to study them in connection with the name of Ricardo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h5 id="heading13"><span class="smcap">The Law of Population</span></h5>

<p>Twenty years had elapsed since the publication of Smith’s immortal
work, without economics making any advance, when the
appearance of a small anonymous volume, known to be the work of
a country clergyman, caused a great sensation. Even after the
lapse of a century the echo of the controversy which it aroused
has not altogether passed away. At first sight one might be led to
think that the book touches only the fringe of economics, seeing
that it is chiefly a statistical study of population, or demography,
as the science is called to-day. But this new science, of which
Malthus must be regarded as the founder, was separated from the
main trunk of economics at a much later date. Furthermore, we
shall find that the influence of his book upon all economic theories,
both of production and distribution, was enormous. The essay
might even be considered a reply to that of Adam Smith. The same
title with slight modification would have served well enough, and
James Bonar wittily remarks that Malthus might have headed it
<i>An Essay on the Causes of the Poverty of Nations</i>.</p>

<p>The attempt to explain the persistence of certain economic
phenomena by connecting them with the presence of a new factor,
biological in its character and differing in its origin both from personal
interest and the mere desire for profit, considerably expanded the
economic horizon and announced the advent of sociology. We know
that Darwin himself acknowledged his indebtedness to the work of
Malthus for the first suggestion of what eventually became the most
celebrated scientific doctrine of the nineteenth century, namely, the
conception of the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest
as one of the mainsprings of progress.</p>

<p>There is no necessity for thinking that the dangers which might
result from an indefinite growth of population had not engaged the
attention of previous writers. In France Buffon and Montesquieu
had already shown some concern in the matter. But a numerous
population was usually regarded as advantageous, and fear of excess
was never entertained inasmuch as it was believed that the number
of people would always be limited by the available means of subsistence.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
This was the view of the Physiocrat Mirabeau, stated in
his own characteristic fashion in his book <i>L’Ami des Hommes</i>, which
has for its sub-title <i>Traité de la Population</i>. Such a natural fact as
the growth of population could possess no terrors for the advocates
of the “natural order.” But in the writings of Godwin this “natural”
optimism assumed extravagant proportions. His book on <i>Political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Justice</i> appeared in 1793 and greatly impressed the public. Godwin,
it has been well said, was the first anarchist who was also a doctrinaire.
At any rate he seems to have been the first to employ that famous
phrase, “Government even in its best state is an evil.” His illimitable
confidence in the future of society and the progress of science,
which he thought would result in such a multiplicity of products
that half a day’s work would be sufficient to satisfy every need,
and his belief in the efficacy of reason as a force which would
restrain personal interest and check the desire for profit, really entitles
him to be considered a pioneer. But life having become so
pleasant, was there no possibility that men might then multiply
beyond the available means of subsistence? Godwin was ignorant
of the terrible intricacies of the problem he had thus raised, and he
experienced no difficulty in replying that such a result, if it ever
came to pass, must take several centuries, for reason may prove as
powerful in controlling the sexual instinct as in restraining the
desire for profit. Godwin even goes so far as to outline a social State
in which reason shall so dominate sense that reproduction will cease
altogether and man will become immortal.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Almost at the same time there appeared in France a volume
closely resembling Godwin’s, entitled <i>Esquisse d’un Tableau historique
des Progrès de l’Esprit humain</i>, written by Condorcet (1794).
It displays the same confidence in the possibility of achieving
happiness through the all-powerful instrumentality of science, which,
if not destined actually to overcome death, was at least going to
postpone it indefinitely.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> This optimistic book, written by a man
who was about to poison himself in order to escape the guillotine,
cannot leave us quite unmoved. But, death abolished, Condorcet
finds that he has to face the old question propounded to Godwin:
“Can the earth always be relied upon to supply sufficient means of
subsistence?” To this question he gives the same answer: either
science will be able to increase the means of subsistence or reason
will prevent an inordinate growth of population.</p>

<p>It was inevitable, in accordance with the law of rhythm which
characterises the movements of thought no less than the forces of
nature, that such hasty optimism should provoke a reaction. It
was not long in coming, and in Malthus’s essay we have it developed
in fullest detail.</p>

<p>To the statement that there are no limits to the progress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mankind either in wealth or happiness, and that the fear of over-population
is illusory, or at any rate so far removed that it need
cause no apprehension, Malthus replied that, on the contrary, we
have in population an almost insurmountable obstacle, not merely
looming in the distant future, but pressing and insistent<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>—the stone
of Sisyphus destined to be the cause of humanity’s ceaseless toil
and final overthrow. Nature has planted an instinct in man which,
left to itself, must result in starvation and death, or vice. This is the
one fact that affords a clue to men’s suffering and a key to the history
of nations and their untold woes.</p>

<p>Everyone, however little acquainted with sociological study,
knows something of the memorable formula by which Malthus endeavoured
to show the contrast between the frightful rapidity with which
population grows when it is allowed to take its own course and the
relative slowness in the growth of the means of subsistence. The
first is represented by a geometrical series where each successive
number is a multiple of the previous one. The second series increases
in arithmetical progression, that is, by simple addition, the illustration
being simply a series of whole numbers:</p>

<table summary="A demonstration of the arithmetical progression">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">1</td>
    <td class="tdr">2</td>
    <td class="tdr">4</td>
    <td class="tdr">8</td>
    <td class="tdr">16</td>
    <td class="tdr">32</td>
    <td class="tdr">64</td>
    <td class="tdr">128</td>
    <td class="tdr">256</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td class="tdr">7</td>
    <td class="tdr">8</td>
    <td class="tdr">9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Every term corresponds to a period of twenty-five years, and a
glance at the figures will show us that population is supposed to
double every twenty-five years, while the means of subsistence
merely increases by an equal amount during each of these periods.
Thus the divergence between the two series grows with astonishing
rapidity. In the table given above, containing only nine terms,
the population figure has already grown to twenty-seven times the
means of subsistence in a period of 225 years. Had the series been
extended up to the hundredth term a numerical representation of
the divergence would have required some ingenuity.</p>

<p>The first progression may be taken as correct, representing as it
does the biological law of generation. The terms “generation” and
“multiplication” are not used as synonyms without some purpose.
It is true that doubling supposes four persons to arrive at the
marriageable age, and this means five or six births if we are to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for the inevitable wastage from infant mortality. This figure appears
somewhat high to those who live in a society where limitation of the
birth-rate is fairly usual. But it is certain that among living beings
in general, including humankind, who are least prolific, the number
of births where no restraint of any kind exists is really much higher.
Women have been known to give birth to twenty or even more
children. And there are no signs of diminishing capacity among the
sexes, for population is still growing. In taking two as his coefficient
Malthus has certainly not overstepped the mark.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The period of twenty-five years as the interval between the two
terms is more open to criticism.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> The practice of reckoning three
generations to a century implies that an interval of about thirty-three
years must elapse between one generation and another.</p>

<p>But these are unimportant details. It is immaterial whether
we lengthen the interval between the two terms from twenty-five
to thirty-three years, or reduce the ratio from 2 to 1½, or even to something
between 1¼ and 1¹/₁₀. The movement will be a little slower,
but it is enough that its geometrical character should be admitted,
for however slow it moves at first it will grow by leaps and bounds
until it surpasses all limits. These corrections fail to touch the real
force of Malthus’s reasoning concerning the law of reproduction.</p>

<p>The series representing the growth of the means of subsistence is
also open to criticism. It is evidently of a more arbitrary character,
and we cannot say whether it is simply supposed to represent a
possible contingency like the first, or whether it pretends to represent
reality. At least it does not correspond to any known and certain
law, such as the law of reproduction. As a matter of fact it rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
seems to give it the lie; for, in short, what is meant by means of
subsistence unless we are to understand the animal and vegetable
species that reproduce themselves according to the same laws as
human beings, only at a much faster rate? The power of reproduction
among plants, like corn or potatoes, or among animals, like
fowls, herrings, cattle even, or sheep, far surpasses that of man. To
this criticism Malthus might have replied as follows. This virtual
power of reproduction possessed by these necessaries of life is in
reality confined to very limited areas of the habitable globe. It is
further restricted by the difficulty of obtaining the proper kind of
nourishment, and by the struggle for existence. But if we admit
exceptions in the one case why not also in the other? It certainly
seems as if there were some inconsistency here. As a matter of fact
we have two different theses. The one attempts to show how
multiplication or reproduction need not of necessity be less rapid
among plants or animals than it is among men. The other expresses
what actually happens by showing that the obstacles to
the indefinite multiplication of men are not less numerous than the
difficulties in the way of an indefinite multiplication of vegetables
or animals, or, in other words, that the former is a function of the
latter.</p>

<p>In order to grasp the true significance of the second formula it
must be translated from the domain of biology into the region of
economics. Malthus evidently thought of it as the amount of corn
yielded by a given quantity of land. The English economists could
think of nothing except in terms of corn! What he wished to
point out was that the utmost we can expect in this matter is that
the increase in the amount of the harvest should be in arithmetical
progression—say, an increase of two hectolitres every twenty-five
years. This hypothesis is really rather too liberal. Lavoisier
in 1789 calculated that the French crop yielded on an average
about 7¾ hectolitres per hectare. During the last few years it
has averaged about 16, and if we admit that the increment has been
regular throughout the 120 years which have since elapsed we have
an increase of 2 hectolitres per 25 years. This rate of increase has
proved sufficient to meet the small increase which has taken place in
the population of France. But would it have sufficed for a population
growing as rapidly as that of England or Germany? Assuredly
not, for these countries, despite their superior yields, are forced to
import from outside a great proportion of the grain which they consume.
The question arises whether France can continue indefinitely
on the same basis during the course of the coming centuries. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
is, indeed, unlikely, for there must be a physical limit to the earth’s
capacity on account of the limited number of elements it contains.
The economic limit will be reached still earlier because of the increasing
cost of attempting to carry on production at these extreme
limits. Thus it seems as if the law of diminishing returns, which we
must study later, were the real basis of the Malthusian laws, although
Malthus himself makes no express mention of it.</p>

<p>It is a truism that the number of people who can live in any place
cannot exceed the number of people who can gain subsistence there.
Any excessive population must, according to definition, die of
hunger.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> This is just what happens in the animal and vegetable
kingdoms. Germs are extraordinarily prolific, but their undue
multiplication is pitilessly retarded by a law which demands the
death of a certain proportion, so that life, like a well-regulated
reservoir, always remains at a mean level, the terrible gaps made
by death being replenished by a new flow. Among savages, just as
among animals, which they much resemble, a large proportion
literally dies of hunger. Malthus devoted much attention to the
study of primitive society, and he must be regarded as one of the
pioneers of prehistoric sociology—a subject that has made much
headway since then.</p>

<p>He proceeds to show how insufficient nourishment always brings
a thousand evils in its train, not merely hunger and death, but also
epidemics and such terrible practices as cannibalism, infanticide, and
slaughter of the old, as well as war, which, even when not undertaken
with a definite view to eating the conquered, always results in robbing
them of their land and the food which it yielded. These are the
“positive” or “repressive” checks.</p>

<p>But it may be replied that both among savages and animals the
cause of this insufficiency of food is an incapacity for production
rather than an excess of population.</p>

<p>Malthus has no difficulty in answering this objection by showing
how savage customs prevailed among such civilised people as the
Greeks. And even among the most modern nations the repressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
checks, somewhat mitigated it is true, are never really absent.
Famine in the sense of absolute starvation is seldom experienced
nowadays, except in Russia and India, perhaps, but it is by no
means a stranger even to the most advanced communities. Tuberculosis,
which involves such terrible bodily suffering, is nothing but
a deadly kind of famine. Lack of food is also responsible for the
abnormally high rate of infant mortality and for the premature
death of the adult worker. As for war, it still demands its toll.
Malthus was living during the wars of the Revolution and the First
Empire—bloody catastrophes that caused the death of about ten
million men, all in the prime of life.</p>

<p>In civilized communities equilibrium is possible through humaner
methods, in the substitution of the preventive check with its reduced
birth-rate for the repressive check with its abnormal death-rate.
Here is an expedient of which only the rational and the provident
can avail themselves, an expedient open only to man. Knowing
that his children are doomed to die—perhaps at an early age—he may
abstain from having any. In reality this is the only efficacious way
of checking the growth of population, for the positive check only
excites new growth, just as the grass that is mown grows all the
more rapidly afterwards. The history of war furnishes many a
striking illustration of this. The year following the terrible war of
1870-71 remains unique in the demographic annals of France on
account of the sudden upward trend of the declining curve of
natality.</p>

<p>It was in the second edition of his book that Malthus expanded
his treatment of the preventive checks, thus softening the somewhat
harsher aspects of his first edition. It is very important that we
should grasp his exact meaning. We therefore make no apology for
frequently quoting his views on one point which is in itself very
important, but upon which the ideas of the reverend pastor of
Haileybury have been so often misrepresented.</p>

<p>The preventive check must be taken to imply moral restraint.
But does this mean abstaining from sexual intercourse during the
period of marriage after the birth, say, of three children, which may
be taken as sufficient to keep the population stationary or moderately
progressive? We cannot find that Malthus ever advocated such
abstention. We have already seen that he considered six children
a normal family, implying the doubling of the population every
twenty-five years. Neither is it suggested that six should be
the maximum, for he adds: “It may be said, perhaps, that even
this degree of prudence might not always avail, as when a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
marries he cannot tell what number of children he shall have, and
many have more than six. This is certainly true.” (P. 536.)</p>

<p>But where does moral restraint come in? This is how he defines
it: “Restraint from marriage which is not followed by irregular
gratifications may properly be termed moral restraint” (p. 9); and to
avoid any possible misunderstanding he adds a note: “By moral
restraint I would be understood to mean a restraint from marriage
from prudential motives with a conduct strictly moral during the
period of this restraint, and I have never intentionally deviated from
this sense.” All this is perfectly explicit. He means abstention
from all sexual intercourse outside the bonds of marriage, and
the postponement of marriage itself until such time as the man can
take upon himself the responsibility of bringing up a family—and
even the complete renunciation of marriage should the economic
conditions never prove favourable.</p>

<p>Malthus unceremoniously rejected the methods advocated by those
who to-day bear his name, and expressly condemned all who favoured
the free exercise of sexual connection, whether within or without
the marriage bond, through the practice of voluntary sterilization.
All these preventive methods are grouped together as vices and their
evil effects contrasted with the practice of moral restraint. Malthus is
equally explicit on this point. “Indeed, I should always particularly
reprobate any artificial and unnatural modes of checking population.
The restraints which I have recommended are quite of a different
character. They are not only pointed out by reason and sanctioned
by religion, but tend in the most marked manner to stimulate
industry.” (P. 572.) And he adds these significant words, so strangely
prophetic so far as France is concerned: “It might be easy to fall
into the opposite mistake and to check the growth of population
altogether.”</p>

<p>It is quite needless to add that if Malthus thus made short work
of conjugal frauds he all the more strongly condemned that other
preventive method, namely, the institution of a special class of
professional prostitutes.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> He would similarly have condemned the
practice of abortion, of which scarcely anything was heard in his day,
but which now appears like a scourge, taking the place of infanticide
and the other barbarous practices of antiquity. Criminal law seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
powerless to suppress it, and it has already received the sanction of a
new morality.</p>

<p>But apart from the question of immoral practices, did Malthus
really believe that moral restraint as he conceived of it would
constitute an effective check upon population?</p>

<p>He doubtless was anxious that it should be so, and he tried to
rouse men to a holy crusade against this worst of all social evils.
“To the Christian I would say that the Scriptures most clearly and
precisely point it out to us as our duty to restrain our passions within
the bounds of reason.… The Christian cannot consider the
difficulty of moral restraint as any argument against its being his
duty.” (P. 452.) And to those who wish to follow the dictates of
reason rather than the observances of religion he remarks: “This
virtue [chastity] appears to be absolutely necessary in order to avoid
certain evils which would otherwise result from the general laws of
nature.” (P. 452.)<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>At bottom he was never quite certain as to the efficacy of moral
restraint. The threatening hydra always peered over the fragile
shield of pure crystal with which he had hoped to do battle.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> He also
felt that celibacy might not merely be ineffective, but would actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
prove dangerous by provoking the vices it was intended to check.
Its prolongation, or worse still its perpetuation, could never be favourable
to good morals.</p>

<p>Malthus was faced with a terrible dilemma, and the uncompromising
ascetic is forced to declare himself a utilitarian philosopher
of the Benthamite persuasion. He has now to condone those practices
which satisfy the sexual instinct without involving maternity,
although at an earlier stage he characterised them as vices. It
seemed to him to be the lesser of two evils, for over-population<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> is
itself the cause of much immorality, with its misery, its promiscuous
living and licence. All of which is very true.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> At the same time the
rule of conduct now prescribed is no longer that of “perfect purity.”
It is, as he himself says, the grand rule of utility. “It is clearly our
duty gradually to acquire a habit of gratifying our passion, only in
that way which is unattended with evil.” (P. 500.) These concessions
only served to prepare the way for the Neo-Malthusians.</p>

<p>Malthus gives us a picture of man at the cross-roads. Straight
in front of him lies the road to misery, on the right the path of virtue,
while on the left is the way of vice. Towards the first man is impelled
by a blind instinct. Malthus warns him to rein in his desires
and seek escape along either by-road, preferably by the path on his
right. But he fears that the number of those who will accept his
advice and choose “the strait road of salvation” will be very small.
On the other hand, he is unwilling to admit, even in the secrecy of his
own soul, that most men will probably follow the road that leads on to
vice, and that masses will rush down the easy slope towards perdition.
In any case the prospect is anything but inviting.</p>

<p class="tb">No doctrine ever was so much reviled. Imprecations have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
showered upon it ever since Godwin’s memorable description of it as
“that black and terrible demon that is always ready to stifle the
hopes of humanity.”</p>

<p>Critics have declared that all Malthus’s economic predictions have
been falsified by the facts, that morally his doctrines have given
rise to the most repugnant practices, and not a few French writers
are prepared to hold him responsible for the decline in the French
birth-rate. What are we to make of these criticisms?</p>

<p>History certainly has not confirmed his fears. No single country
has shown that it is suffering from over-population. In some cases—that
of France, for example—population has increased only very
slightly. In others the increase has been very considerable, but
nowhere has it outstripped the increase in wealth.</p>

<p>The following table, based upon the decennial censuses, gives
the <i>per capita</i> wealth of the population of the United States, the
country from which Malthus obtained many of his data:</p>

<p>In fifty years the wealth of every inhabitant has more than
quadrupled, although the population in the same interval also shows
a fourfold increase (23 millions to 92 millions).<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Great Britain, <i>i.e.</i> England and Scotland, at the time Malthus
wrote (1800-5), had a population of 10½ millions. To-day it has
a population of 40 millions. Such a figure, had he been able to
foresee it, would have terrified Malthus. But the wealth and
prosperity of Great Britain have in the meantime probably quadrupled
also.</p>

<p>Does this prove the claim that is constantly being made, that
Malthus’s laws are not borne out by the facts? We think that it is
correct to say that the laws still remain intact, but that the conclusions
which he drew from them were unwarranted. No one can
deny that living beings of every kind, including the human
species, multiply in geometrical progression. Left to itself, with
no check, such increase would exceed all limits. The increase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
industrial products, on the other hand, must of necessity be limited
by the numerous conditions which regulate all production—that is,
by the amount of space available, the quantity of raw material, of
capital and labour, etc. If the growth of population has not outstripped
the increase in wealth, but, as appears from the figures
we have given, has actually lagged behind it, it is because population
has been voluntarily limited, not only in France, where the preventive
check is in full swing, but also in almost every other country.
This voluntary limitation which gave Malthus such trouble is one
of the commonest phenomena of the present time.</p>

<p>Malthus’s apprehensions appear to involve some biological confusion.
The sexual and the reproductive instincts are by no means
one and the same;<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> they are governed by entirely different motives.
Only to the first can be attributed that character of irresistibility
which he wrongly attributes to the second. The first is a mere
animal instinct which rouses the most impetuous of passions and is
common to all men. The second is frequently social and religious
in its origins, assuming different forms according to the exigencies of
time and place.</p>

<p>To the religious peoples who adopted the laws of Moses, of Manu,
or of Confucius to beget issue was to ensure salvation and to realise
true immortality.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> For the Brahmin, the Chinese, or the Jew not to
have children meant not merely a misfortune, but a life branded with
failure. Among the Greeks and Romans the rearing of children was
a sacred duty laid upon every citizen and patriot. An aristocratic
caste demanded that the glories of its ancestors and founders should
never be allowed to perish for the want of heirs. Even among the
working classes, whose lot is often miserable and always one of
economic dependence, there are some who are buoyed up by the
hope that the more children they have the larger will be their weekly
earnings and the greater their power of enlisting public sympathy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
And in every new country there is a demand for labourers to
cultivate its virgin soil and to build up a new people.</p>

<p>The reproductive instinct, on the other hand, may be thwarted
by antagonistic forces—by the selfishness of parents who shun their
responsibilities, or of mothers who dread the pains and perils of
child-bearing; by the greed of parents who would endow old age
rather than foster youth; by the desire of women to enjoy independence
rather than seek marriage; by the too early emancipation
of children, which leaves to the parents no gains and no joys beyond
the cost and trouble of upbringing; by insufficient house-room or
exorbitant taxation, or by any one of a thousand causes.</p>

<p>Thus the considerations that influence reproduction are infinitely
varied, and being of a social character they are neither necessary nor
permanent, nor yet universal. They may very well be defeated by
motives that belong to the social order, and this is just what happens.
And it is at least possible to conceive of a state of society where
religious faith has vanished and patriotism is dead, where the family
lasts only for one generation, and where all land has been appropriated
so that the calling of the father is denied to the son; where existence
has again become nomadic and suffering unbearable, and where
marriage, easily annulled by divorce, has become more or less of a
free union. In such a community, with all incentives to reproduction
removed and all antagonistic forces in full operation, the birth-rate
would fall to zero. And if all nations have not yet arrived at this
stage they all seem to be tending towards it. It is true that a new
social environment may give rise to new motives. We believe
that it will, but as yet we are ignorant of the nature of these
promptings.</p>

<p>Paradoxical as it may seem, the sexual instinct plays quite a
secondary <i>rôle</i> in the procreation of the human species. Nature
doubtless has united the two instincts by giving them the same organs,
and those who believe in final causes can admire the ruse which
Nature has adopted for securing the preservation of the species by
coupling generation with sexual attraction. But man has displayed
ingenuity even greater than Nature’s by separating the two functions.
He now finds that (since he has known how to get rid of reproduction)
he can gratify his lust without being troubled by the consequences.
The fears of Malthus have vanished: the other spectre, race suicide,
is new casting a gloom over the land.</p>

<p>Malthus’s condemnation of such practices was of little avail.
Other moralists more indulgent than the master have given them
their sanction by endeavouring to show that this is the only way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
which men can perform a double function, on the one hand giving
full scope to sexual instinct in accordance with the physiological and
psychological laws of their being, and on the other taking care not
to leave such a supreme duty as that of child-bearing to mere chance
and not to impose upon womankind such an exhausting task as
that of maternity save when freely and voluntarily undertaken.
This is quite contrary to the pastor’s teaching concerning moral
restraint. The Neo-Malthusians, on the other hand, consider his
teaching very immoral, as being contrary to the laws of physiology,
infected with ideas of Christian asceticism, and altogether worse
than the evil it seeks to remedy. His rule of enforced celibacy
might, in their opinion, involve more suffering even than want of
food, and late marriages simply constitute an outrage upon morality
by encouraging prostitution and increasing the number of illegitimate
births. The Neo-Malthusians<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> persist in regarding themselves as
his disciples because they think that he clearly demonstrated, despite
himself perhaps, that the exercise of the blind instinct of reproduction
must result in the multiplication of human beings who are
faced by want and disease and liable to sudden extinction or slow
degradation, and that the only way of avoiding this is to check the
instinct.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe, however, that were Malthus now alive
he would not be a Neo-Malthusian. He would not have willingly
pardoned his disciples the perpetration of sexual frauds which enable
man to be freed from the responsibilities which Nature intended
him to bear. Nevertheless we must recognise that the concessions
which he made prepared the way for this further development.</p>

<p>Malthus did not seem to realise the full import of these delicate
questions which contributed so powerfully to the overthrow of his
doctrine. Especially is this true of the emphasis which he laid upon
chastity, involving as he thought abstention from the joys of marriage.
Such celibacy he would impose only upon the poor.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
rich are obviously so circumstanced that children cannot be a
hindrance. We know well enough that it was in the interests of the
poor themselves that Malthus imposed his cruel law “not to bring
beings into the world for whom the means of support cannot be
found.” But that does not prevent its emphasising in the most
heartless fashion imaginable the inequality of their conditions, forcing
the poor to choose between want of bread and celibacy. Malthus
gave a quietus to the old song which eulogises love in a cottage as the
very acme of happiness. It is only just to remark, however, that he
does not go so far as to put an interdict upon marriage altogether,
which is actually the case in some countries. The old liberal economist
asserts himself here. He sees clearly enough that, leaving aside
all humanitarian considerations, the remedy offered would be worse
than the evil, for its only result would be a diminution in the number
of legitimate children and an increase in the number of those born
out of wedlock.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>When telling the poor that they themselves were the authors of
their misery,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> because of their improvident habits, their early
marriages, and their large families, and that no written law, no
institution, and no effort of charity could in any way remedy it, he
failed to realise that he was furnishing the propertied classes with a
good pretext for dissociating themselves from the fate of the working
classes.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> And during the century which has passed since he wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the way to every comprehensive scheme of socialistic or communistic
organisation has been barred and every projected reform which
claimed to ameliorate the condition of the poor effectively thwarted
by the argument that the only result would be to increase the
number of participators as well as the amount to be distributed,
and that consequently no one would be any the better off.</p>

<p>Whatever opposition Malthus’s doctrines may have aroused, his
teaching has long since become a part and parcel of economic science.
Occasionally it has thwarted legitimate claims, while at other times
it has been used to buttress some well-known Classical doctrine, such
as the law of rent or the wages fund theory. On more than one
occasion it has done service in the defence of family life and private
property, two institutions which are supposed to act as effective
checks upon the growth of population, because of the responsibilities
which they involve.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The population question has lost none of its importance, although
it has somewhat changed its aspect. What Malthus called the
preventive check has got such a hold of almost every country that
modern economists and sociologists are concerned not so much
with the question of an unlimited growth of population as with the
regular and universal decline of the birth-rate. Everyone is further
agreed that the causes must be social.</p>

<p>It is not enough to say that the cause is a deliberate determination
of parents to have no children or to have only a limited number.
The question is, Why do they decide to have none or to limit their
family to a certain number only? Why is this limitation more
marked in France than elsewhere, and why is it more pronounced
there to-day than it was say two or three generations ago? The
special causes which apply to the France of to-day must somehow
be discovered, and such causes may be expected to be less active
elsewhere. It may be that Paul Leroy-Beaulieu is right when he
claims that the progress of civilisation must always mean a declining
birth-rate, because the fresh needs and desires and the extra expenditure
which it necessarily involves are incompatible with the duties
and responsibilities of maternity. It is possible that it diminishes
as democracy advances, because the latter strengthens the telescopic
faculty and quickens the desire to rise in the social scale as
rapidly and as effectively as possible. M. Dumont, who advocates
this view, has happily named it the law of capillarity. More
precise causes are sometimes invoked, but they vary according
to the particular school that formulates them. Le Play thinks
that it is due to the practice of social inheritance. Paul Bureau
takes it as a sign of the weakening of moral and religious belief, and
of the growth of intemperate habits of every kind—alcoholism,
debauchery, etc. Unfortunately none of the explanations given seem
quite satisfactory, and a second Malthus is required to open up a new
chapter in the history of demography.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading14">II: RICARDO</h4>

<p>Next to Smith, Ricardo is the greatest name in economics, and
fiercer controversy has centred round his name than ever raged
around the master’s. Smith founded no school, and his wisdom and
moderation saved him from controversy. Hence every economist,
whatever his views, is found sitting at his feet straining to catch the
divine accents as they fall from his lips.</p>

<p>But Ricardo was no dweller in ethereal regions. He was in the
thickest of the fight—the butt of every shaft. In discussions on the
question of method the attack is always directed against Ricardo,
who is charged with being the first to lead the science into the fruitless
paths of abstraction. The Ricardian theory of rent affords a target
for every Marxian in his general attack upon private property. The
Ricardian theory of value is the starting-point of modern socialism—a
kinship that he could never have disavowed, however little to his
taste. The same thing is true of controversies concerning banks
of issue and international trade: Ricardo’s place was ever with
the vanguard.</p>

<p>His defects are as interesting as his merits, and have been equally
influential. Of his theories, especially his more characteristic ones,
there is now little left, unless we recall what is after all quite as important—the
criticisms they aroused and the adverse theories which
they begot. The city banker was a very indifferent writer, and his
work is adorned with none of those beautiful passages so characteristic
of Smith and Stuart Mill. No telling phrase or striking
epithet ever meets the eye of the reader. His principal work is
devoid of a plan, its chapters being mere fragments placed in
juxtaposition. His use of the hypothetical method and the constant
appeal to imaginary conditions makes its reading a task of
some difficulty. This abstract method has long held dominion over
the science, and it is still in full activity among the Mathematical
economists. His thoughts are penetrating, but his exposition is
frequently obscure, and a remark which he makes somewhere in
speaking of other writers, namely, that they seldom know their own
strength, may very appropriately be applied to him. But obscurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of style has not clouded his fame. Indeed, it has stood him in good
stead, as it did Marx at a later date. We hardly like to say that a
great writer is unintelligible—a feeling prompted partly by respect
and partly arising out of fear lest the lack of intelligence should really
be on our side. The result is an attempt to discover a profound
meaning in the most abstruse passage—an attempt that is seldom
fruitful, especially in the case of Ricardo.</p>

<p>It is clearly impossible to outline the whole of this monumental
work. We shall content ourselves with an attempt to place the
leading conceptions clearly before our readers.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>Speaking generally, Ricardo’s chief concern is with the distribution
of wealth. He was thus instrumental in opening up a new
field of economic inquiry, for his predecessors had been largely
engrossed with production. “To determine the laws which regulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
this distribution is the principal problem in political economy.”
We have already some acquaintance with the tripartite division of
revenues corresponding with the threefold division of the factors of
production—the rent of land, the profits of capital, and the wages
of labour. Ricardo wanted to determine the way in which this
division took place and what laws regulated the proportion which
each claimant got. Although unhampered by any preconceptions
concerning the justice or injustice of distribution, we can easily
understand how he ushered in the era of polemics and of socialistic
discussion, seeing that the natural laws pale into insignificance
when contrasted with the influence wielded by human institutions
and written laws. The latter override the former, and individual
interests which may co-operate in production frequently prove
antagonistic in distribution.</p>

<p>We shall follow him in his exposition of the laws of rent, wages,
and profits, but especially rent, for according to him the share given
to land determines the proportions which the other factors are going
to receive.</p>

<p>One would imagine that an indispensable preliminary to this study
would be an examination of the Ricardian theory of value, especially
when we recall the importance of his theory of labour-value in the
history of economics doctrine and how it prepared the way for the
Marxian theory of surplus value, which is the foundation-stone of
contemporary socialism. Despite all this we shall only refer to his
theory of value incidentally, and chiefly in connection with the laws of
distribution. We have Ricardo’s own authority for doing this:
“After all, the great problem of rent, of wages, or of profits might
be elucidated by determining the proportions in which the total
product is distributed between the proprietors, the capitalists, and the
workers, but this is not necessarily connected with the doctrine of
value.”<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>It is, moreover, probable that Ricardo himself did not begin with
an elaborate theory of value from which he deduced the laws of
distribution, but after having discovered, or having convinced
himself that he had discovered, the laws of distribution he attempted
to deduce from them a theory of value. One idea had haunted
him his whole life long, namely, that with the progress of time nature
demanded an ever-increasing application of human toil. No doubt
it was this that suggested to him that labour was the foundation,
the cause, and the measure of value. But he never came to a final
decision on the question, and his statements concerning it are frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
contradictory. We must also confess that his theory of value
is far from being his most characteristic work. In the elucidation of
that difficult question, vigorous thinker though he was, he has not
been much more fortunate than his predecessors. He himself
acknowledged this on more than one occasion, and shortly before his
death, with a candour that does him honour, he recognised his
failure to explain value.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<h5 id="heading15">1. <span class="smcap">The Law of Rent</span></h5>

<p>Of all Ricardian theories that of rent is the most celebrated, and
it is also the one most inseparably connected with Ricardo’s name.
So well known is it that Stuart Mill spoke of it as the economic <i>pons
asinorum</i>, and it has always been one of the favourite subjects of
examiners.</p>

<p>The question of rent—that is, of the return which land yields—had
occupied the attention of others besides Ricardo. It was the
burning question of the day. The problem of rent dominated
English political economy during the first half of the nineteenth
century, and a later period has witnessed a revival of it in the land
nationalisation policy of Henry George. In France there was but
a feeble echo of the controversy, for France even long before the
Revolution had been a country of small proprietors. Landlordism
was far less common there, and where it existed its characteristics
were very different. That threefold hierarchy which consisted of
a worker toiling for a daily wage in the employ of a capitalist farmer
who draws his profits towered over by a landlord in receipt of rents
formed a kind of microcosmic picture of the universal process of
distribution, but it was seldom as clearly seen in France as it was
in England.</p>

<p>The first two incomes presented no difficulties. But how are we
to explain that other income—that revenue which had created English
aristocracy and made English history? The Physiocrats had named
it the “net product,” and they argued a liberality of nature and a
gift of God. Adam Smith, although withholding the title of creator
from nature and bestowing it upon labour, nevertheless admits that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a notable portion—perhaps as much as a third of the revenue of land—is
due to the collaboration of nature.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Malthus had already produced a book on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> and
Ricardo hails him as the discoverer of the true doctrine of rent.
Malthus takes as his starting-point the explanation offered by the
Physiocrats and Adam Smith, namely, that rent is the natural
outcome of some special feature possessed by the earth and given it
by God—that is, the power of enabling more people to live on it
than are required to till it. Rent is the result, not of a merely physical
law, but also of an economic one, for nature seems to have a unique
power of creating a demand for its products, and consequently of
maintaining and even of increasing indefinitely both its own revenue
and value. The reason for this is that the population always tends
to equal and sometimes to surpass the means of subsistence. In
other words, the number of people born is seldom less than the
maximum number that the earth can feed. This new theory of
rent is a simple deduction from Malthus’s law concerning the constant
pressure of population upon the means of subsistence.</p>

<p>Malthus emphasised another important feature of rent, and it was
this characteristic that especially attracted Ricardo. Seeing that
different parts of the earth are of unequal fertility, the capitals employed
in cultivation must of necessity yield unequal profits. The
difference between the normal rate of profit on mediocre lands and
the superior rate yielded by the more fertile land constitutes a special
kind of profit which is immediately seized by the owner of the more
fertile land. This extra profit afterwards became known as differential
rent.</p>

<p>To Malthus, as well as to the Physiocrats, this kind of rent seemed
perfectly legitimate and conformed to the best interests of the public.
It was only the just recompense for the “strength and talent”
exercised by the original proprietors. The same argument applies
to those who have since bought the land, for it must have been
bought with the “fruits of industry and talent.” Its benefits
are permanent and independent of the proprietor’s labour, and in
this way the possession of land becomes a much-coveted prize, the
<i>otium cum dignitate</i> which is the just reward of meritorious effort.</p>

<p>Ricardo enters upon an entirely new track. He breaks the
connection with Smith and the Physiocrats—a connection that
Malthus had been most anxious to maintain. All suggestion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
co-operation on the part of nature is brushed aside with contempt.
Business-man and owner of property as he was, he had no superstitious
views concerning nature, whose work he contemplated
without much feeling of reverence. As against the celebrated phrase
of Adam Smith he quotes that of Buchanan: “The notion of
agriculture yielding a produce and a rent in consequence because
nature concurs with human industry in the process of cultivation
is a mere fancy.”<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> He proceeds to defend the converse of Smith’s
view and to show how rent implies the avarice rather than the
liberality of nature.</p>

<p>The proof that the earth’s fertility, taken by itself, can never
be the cause of rent is easily seen in the case of a new country. In
a newly founded colony, for example, land yields no rent, however
fertile, if the quantity of land is in excess of the people’s demand.
“For no one would pay for the use of land when there was an abundant
quantity not yet appropriated, and therefore at the disposal of
whosoever might choose to cultivate it.”<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Rent only appears “when
the progress of population calls into cultivation land of an inferior
quality or less advantageously situated.” Here we have the very
kernel of Ricardo’s theory. Instead of being an indication of
nature’s generosity, rent is the result of the grievous necessity of
having recourse to relatively poor land under the pressure of population
and want.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> “Rent is a creation of value, not of wealth,” says
Ricardo—a profound saying, and one that has illuminated many a
mystery attaching to the theory of rent. In that sentence he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
draws a distinction between wealth born of abundance and satisfaction
and value begotten of difficulty and effort, and he declares
that rent is of the second category and not of the first.</p>

<p>Still, this cannot be accepted as the final explanation. It is
difficult to understand how a purely negative condition such as the
absence of fertile land could ever create a revenue. It were better
to say that the want of suitable land supplies the occasion for the
appearance of rent, although it is not its cause. The cause is the
high price of agricultural products—say corn—due to the increased
difficulty of cultivating the less fertile lands.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> In short, the cause
and the measure of the rent of corn-land are determined by the
quantity of labour necessary to produce corn under the most unfavourable
circumstances, “meaning by the most unfavourable
circumstances the most unfavourable under which the quantity of
produce required renders it necessary to carry on production.”<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Let us assume, as Ricardo did, that first-class land yields a bushel
of corn as the result of ten hours’ work, the corn selling for ten
shillings a bushel.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In order to supply a population that is increasing
in accordance with the Malthusian formula, land of the second class
has to be cultivated, when the production of a bushel requires
fifteen hours’ work. The value of corn will rise proportionately to
fifteen shillings, and landed proprietors of the first class will draw
a surplus value or a bonus of five shillings per bushel. So rent
emerges. Presently the time for cultivating lands of the third
class will approach, when twenty hours’ labour will be necessary for
the production of a bushel. The price of corn goes up to twenty
shillings, and proprietors of the first class see their gift increased or
their rent raised from five to ten shillings per bushel, while the owners
of the second-class land obtain a bonus of five shillings per bushel.
This marks the advent of a new class of rent-receivers, who modestly
take their place a little below the first class. The third class of landowner
will receive a rent whenever the cultivation of fourth-class land
becomes a necessity.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been said in criticism of the theory that the hierarchy of
lands has simply been invented for the purpose of illustrating the
theory. But what Ricardo has really done is to put in scientific
language what every peasant knows—what has been handed down to
him from father to son in unbroken succession, namely, that all land
is not equally fertile.</p>

<p>Ricardo, so often represented as a purely abstract thinker, was
in reality a very practical man and a close observer of those facts that
were then occupying the attention of both public and Parliament.
High rents, following upon high prices, constituted the most important
phenomenon in the economic history of England towards the end
of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries.
Right through the eighteenth century—that is, up to 1794—the
highest price paid for corn was only a few pence above 60s. per
quarter. But in 1796 the price rose to 92s., and in 1801 it reached
177s.—nearly three times the old price. The exceptionally high
price, due to extraordinary causes, chief among them being the
Napoleonic wars and the Continental blockade, could not last long,
although the average during the years 1810-13 remained as high
as 106s.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>This high price of corn was not entirely due to accidental causes.
Something must be attributed to the fact that the available land was
insufficient for the upkeep of the population, and that new land
had to be cultivated irrespective of situation or degree of fertility.
The pastures which had formerly covered England were daily disappearing
before the plough. It was the period of the iniquitous
Enclosure Acts, when landlords set their hearts upon enclosing the
common lands. Professor Cannan has drawn up an interesting
chart to show the close correspondence between the progress of the
enclosure movement and the high price of corn.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1813 a Commission appointed by the House of Commons to
inquire into the price of corn—for the proprietors dreaded the day
when the return of peace would allow of importation—came to the
conclusion that new lands could not produce corn at a less cost than
80s. a quarter. What an argument for Ricardo’s theory!<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>But is there no possible means of avoiding the cultivation of lands
of the second and third order? Intensive cultivation might doubtless
do something to swell the returns on the older lands, but only
up to a certain point. It would be absurd to imagine that on a
limited area of land an unlimited quantity of subsistence can be produced.
There must be a limit somewhere—an elastic limit perhaps,
and one which the progress of science will push farther and farther
away, even beyond our wildest hopes. But the cultivator stops
long before this ideal limit is reached, for practice has taught him
that the game is not worth the candle, because the outlay of capital
and labour exceeds the profits on the return. This practical limit
is determined for him by the law of diminishing returns.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>That law is indispensable to an understanding of the Ricardian
theory, and is implied in Malthus’s theory of population. Its discovery
is still earlier, and we have an admirable statement of it in Turgot’s
writings: “It can never be imagined that a doubling of expenditure
would result in doubling the product.” Malthus, unconsciously no
doubt, repeated Turgot’s dictum.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> It is evident, says he, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
as cultivation extends, the annual addition made to the average
product must continually diminish.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Ricardo witnessed the operation
of the law under his very eyes, and he frequently hinted at the decreasing
returns yielded by capital successively applied to the same land.
Even in cases of that kind, where recourse to new lands was impossible,
rents were bound to increase.</p>

<p>Taking again land No. 1, which yields corn at 10s. a bushel, let
us imagine that there is an increased demand for wheat. Instead of
breaking up land No. 2 an attempt might be made to increase the
yield on No. 1, but nothing will be gained by it because the new
bushel produced on No. 1 will cost 15s., which is just what it would
cost if raised on second-class land. Furthermore, the price will now
rise to 15s., and the two bushels will be disposed of for 30s., thus
giving the proprietor a rent of 5s., because they have only cost 25s.
to produce.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>There is still another possibility, however. Resort might be had
to emigration and colonists might be encouraged to cultivate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
best soils of distant lands, soils equal in fertility to those in the first
class. The products of such lands would be got in exchange for
the manufactured goods of the home country, to which the law of
diminishing returns does not apply. But some account of the cost
of transport, which increases the cost of production, must be taken,
and this leads to the same result, namely, a rent for those nearest the
market, because of the advantages of a superior situation. Distance
and sterility, as J. B. Say remarks, are the same thing. If land in
America yields corn at 10s. a bushel and freightage equals 5s., it is clear
that corn imported into England must sell for 15s.—exactly the same
condition of things as if land of the second order had been cultivated,
and English landlords of the first class will still draw a rent of 5s.
This third possibility was scarcely mentioned by Ricardo, and he
could hardly have foreseen the wonderful developments in transportation
that took place during the next fifty years, which resulted
in a reversal of the law of diminishing returns and the confuting
of the prophets.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The great Ricardian theory, <i>prima facie</i> self-evident, is in reality
based upon a number of postulates to which we must pay more
attention. Some of them must be regarded as economic axioms, but
the validity of others is somewhat more doubtful.</p>

<p>In the first place there is the assumption that the produce of lands
unequally fertile and representing unequal amounts of labour will
always sell at the same price, or, in other words, will always possess
the same exchange value. Is this proposition demonstrably sound?
It is true when the product in question—for example, corn—is of
uniform quality and kind. When the goods offered on the same
market are so much alike that it is a matter of indifference to the
buyer whether he takes the one or the other, then it is true that he
will not pay a higher price for the one than he will for the other.
This is what Jevons called the “law of indifference.”<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
In the second place it is implied that this exchange value, uniform
for all identical products, is determined by the maximum amount
of labour required for its production, or, in other words, by the
amount of labour necessary for the production of the more costly
portion.</p>

<p>This brings us to the Ricardian theory of value. We know that
he considered that the value of everything was determined by the
amount of labour necessary for its production.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Adam Smith had
already declared that value was proportional to the amount of labour
employed, but that this was the case only in primitive societies. “In
civilised society, on the contrary, there is a still smaller number [of
cases] in which it consists altogether in the wages of labour.” Labour
was regarded by Smith as one of the factors determining value—though
by no means the only one, land and capital being obviously
the others.</p>

<p>But Ricardo simplified matters, as abstract thinkers frequently
do, by neglecting the last-named factors. This leaves us only labour.
Land is dismissed because rent contributes nothing to the creation of
value, but is itself entirely dependent upon value.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Corn is not dear
because land yields rent, but land yields rent because corn is dear.
“The clearly understanding this principle is, I am persuaded, of the
utmost importance to the science of political economy.” As for
capital, why should we make a special factor of it, seeing that it is
only labour? Its connotation might be extended so as to include
“the labour bestowed not on their immediate production only, but
on all those implements or machines required to give effect to the
particular labour to which they were applied.”<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> But Ricardo was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
not thoroughly satisfied with this identification of capital and labour,
and, great capitalist that he was, it must have caused him much
searching of heart. Furthermore, it was not very easy to apply the
conception to such commodities as timber and wine, which increase
in value as they advance in age. In a letter to McCulloch he admits
the weakness of his theory. After all the study that he had given to
the matter, he had to confess that the relative value of commodities
appeared to be determined by two causes: (1) the relative quantity of
labour necessary for its production; (2) the relative length of time
required to bring the commodity to market. He seems to have had
a presentiment of the operation of a new and distinct factor, to which
Böhm-Bawerk was to ascribe such importance.</p>

<p>The usual method of stating the Ricardian theory of value is to
say that value is determined by cost of production. It is also the
correct way, inasmuch as he stated it thus himself. It is, however,
quite a different thing to say on the one hand that value is determined
by labour and on the other that it depends upon the sum of
wages and profits (supposing we omit rent).<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> On this point, as
on several others, obscurity of thought alone saves Ricardo from
the reproach of self-contradiction.</p>

<p>Suppose we proceed a step farther. The statement that value is
determined by labour is not enough to account for the phenomenon
of rent. Let us imagine a market where three sacks of corn are
available for sale. Let us further suppose that the production of each
involved a different quantity of labour, one being produced on land
that was very fertile, the other on soil that was less generous, etc.
Every sack will sell at the same price, but the question is, which of
those different quantities of labour is the one that determines the
price? Ricardo replies that it is the maximum quantity, and the
value of the corn is determined by the value of that sack which is
produced under the greatest disadvantages. But why should it
not be determined by the value of the sack grown under the most
favourable circumstances, or by the value of that other sack raised
under conditions of average difficulty?</p>

<p>That is impossible. Let us imagine that the three sacks of corn
came from three different kinds of land, A, B, and C, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
necessary quantities of labour were respectively 10, 15, and 20. It
is inconceivable that the price should fall below 20, the cost of
production of corn grown on C, for if it did C would no longer be
cultivated; but the produce of C is <i>ex hypothesi</i> indispensable. The
market price cannot rise above 20, for in that case lands of the fourth
class would be brought under cultivation, and their yield would be
added to the quantity already on the market. The supposition
is that the quantity of corn on the market is already sufficient to
meet the demand, and the increase in supply would soon cause the
price to fall again to the irreducible minimum of 20.</p>

<p>We cannot but admire the ingenuity of a demonstration that
seeks to explain a phenomenon like rent—which is a revenue obtained
independently of all labour—by the aid of a generalisation
which regards labour as the one source of value. But the explanation
is ingenious rather than convincing, for it is quite clear that only in
the case of one of the sacks do value and amount of labour actually
coincide. In the two other instances the quantity of labour and
exchange value are absolutely and indefinitely divergent.</p>

<p>Most contemporary economists, while denying that value is
solely the product of labour and preferring to regard it as a reflection
of human preferences, would willingly recognise the element of
truth contained in the Ricardian view. But it must be understood
in the sense that competition, although tending to reduce price to the
level of cost of production, cannot reduce it below the maximum
cost of production, or the price necessary to repay the expenses of
producing the most costly portion of the total amount demanded
by the market.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> In this sense it is true not only of agricultural
but also of all other products, and it has a wider scope than was at
first ascribed to it by its authors. Rent is nowadays recognised as
an element which enters into all incomes. But with an extension of
sway has gone attenuation, and the term has lost something of its
original significance and precision. To-day rent is treated as the
outcome of certain favourable conjunctures, which are to be found
in all stations in life, and it is no uncommon thing to speak of
consumer’s rent even.</p>

<p>The Ricardian theory, moreover, presupposed the existence of
a class of land which yielded no rent, the returns which it gave
being only just sufficient to cover cost of production. In other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
words, Ricardo only recognised the existence of differential rents,
and dismissed the other cases mentioned by Malthus.</p>

<p>It really seems as if Malthus were in this instance more correct
than Ricardo. It is quite possible that in the colonies, for example,
there may be lands which yield no rent because of the superabundance
of fertile land. Or the same thing may occur in an old country
because of the extreme poverty of the land. But it is quite evident
that in a society having a certain density of population the mere
fact that there exists only a limited amount of land is enough to
give to all lands and to their products a scarcity value independent
of unequal returns. Nor would the case be materially different if
all lands were supposed to be of equal fertility, for who would be
willing to cultivate land which only yielded the bare equivalent of
the expenses of production?</p>

<p>Ricardo’s unwillingness to recognise this other class of rent, which
depends solely upon the limited quantity of land, was due to the
fact that it would have contradicted his other theory that there is no
value except labour. It is true that he made an exception of some
rare “products,” such as valuable paintings, statuary, books,
medals, first-class wines, etc., the quantity of which could not be
increased by labour. Nobody would have taken any notice of such
a slight omission as that, but had he left out such an important
item of wealth as the earth itself there would be great danger of the
whole theory crumbling to dust.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p class="tb">Such is the theory of rent, celebrated above all economic doctrines,
and concerning which it might be said that no doctrine, not
even that of Malthus, has ever excited such impassioned criticism.
For this there are several reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, it led to an overthrow of the majesty of the
“natural order” by simply depicting some of its gloomier aspects.
Men had been led to believe that the “order” was for ever beyond
challenge. Now, however, it seemed that if the new doctrine was
true then the interests of the landed proprietors were opposed not
only to those of every other class in the community—for sharing
always begets antagonism—but also to the general interest of society
as a whole.</p>

<p>For what are the real interests of proprietors? First, that
population and its demands should increase as rapidly as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in order that men may be forced to cultivate new lands, and that
these new lands should be as sterile as possible, requiring much
toil and thus causing an increase in rents. Exhaustive labour
bestowed upon the cultivation of land that is gradually becoming
poorer and poorer would soon make the fortune of every landlord.</p>

<p>As a class, proprietors have every interest in retarding the progress
of agricultural science, a paradox which the slightest reflection
will show to be true. Every advance in agricultural science must
mean more products from the same amount of land and a check upon
the law of diminishing returns, resulting in lower prices and reduced
rents, since it would no longer be necessary to cultivate the poorer
soils. In a word, since rent is measured by reference to the obstacles
which thwart cultivation, just as the level of water in a pond is
determined by the height of the sluice, everything that tends to
lower this obstacle must reduce the rent. In mitigation of this charge
it must, however, be noted that, taken individually, every proprietor
is of necessity interested in agricultural improvement, because he
may have an opportunity of benefiting by larger crops before the
improvements have become general enough to lower prices and to
push back the margin of cultivation. If every proprietor argued in
this way, individual interest would finally cheat itself, to the advantage
of the general public. But this is nothing to be very proud of.</p>

<p>Ricardo set out to demonstrate the antagonism,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> and with what
a vigorous pen does he not picture it! The study of this question of
rent made of him a Free Trader stauncher than Adam Smith, more
firmly convinced than the Physiocrats. Free Trade was for them
founded upon the conception of a general harmony of interests, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Ricardo built his faith upon one clearly demonstrated fact—the high
price of corn and its concomitant, high rents. Free Trade seemed to
be the means of checking this disastrous movement. The free
importation of corn implied the cultivation of distant lands as rich
as or even richer than any in Britain. All this meant avoiding the
cultivation of inferior lands and reducing the high price of corn.</p>

<p>He was also desirous of proving to the proprietors that the practice
of free exchange, even though it might involve some loss of revenue
to them, was really to their interest. Their opposition, he thought,
was very short-sighted. “They fail to see,” he writes, “that commerce
everywhere tends to increase production, and that as a result
of this increased production general well-being is also improved,
although there may be partial loss as the result of it. To be consistent
with themselves they ought to try to arrest all improvement
in agriculture and manufacture and all invention of machinery.”<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>The theory of rent, in the second place, endangered the reputation
of landowners by showing that their income is not the product of
labour, and is consequently anti-social. No wonder that it has been
so severely criticised by conservative economists. Ricardo himself,
however, seemed quite unconscious of the nature of the blow thus
aimed at the institution of private property. His indifference,
which appears to us so surprising, is partly explained by the fact that
the theory absolved the proprietor from all responsibility in the
matter. Unlike profits and wages, rent does not figure in cost of
production because it makes no contribution to the price of corn,
but is itself wholly determined by that price.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> The landed proprietor
thus appears as the most innocent of the co-partners, playing a purely
passive <i>rôle</i>. He does not produce rent, but simply accepts it.</p>

<p>That may be; but the fact that the proprietor plays no part
in the production of rent, whilst exonerating him from complicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in its invidious consequences, spells ruin to his title of proprietor—that
is, if we consider labour to be the only title to proprietorship.
It was just this aspect of the question that drew the attention of
Ricardo’s contemporary James Mill. Mill advocated the confiscation
of rent or its socialisation by means of taxation.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> He thus became a
pioneer in the movement for land nationalisation, a cause that has
since been championed by such writers as Colins, Gossen, Henry
George, and Walras.</p>

<p>Finally, the theory of rent seems to give colour to certain theories
which predict an extremely dark future for the race, corroborating the
gloomy forebodings of Malthus. As society grows and advances it will
be forced to employ lands that are less fertile and means of production
that are more onerous. It seems as if the curse uttered in Genesis has
been scientifically verified. “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring
forth to thee; … in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.”</p>

<p>True, he did not carry his pessimism so far as to say that as the
result of this fatal exhaustion of this most precious instrument of
production the progress of mankind would for ever be arrested by
the ravages of famine. Other beneficent forces, the progress of
agricultural science and a larger employment of capital, would surmount
the difficulty. “Although the lands that are actually being
cultivated may be inferior to those which were in cultivation some
years ago, and consequently production is becoming more difficult,
can anyone doubt that the quantity of products does not greatly
exceed that formerly produced?”</p>

<p>Ricardo’s theory does not involve a denial of progress. But it
shows how the struggle is becoming more and more difficult, and how
scarcity and want, if not actual famine, must lie in the path along
which we are advancing. Suppose Great Britain were now to
attempt to feed her 45 million inhabitants from her own soil, would
there be much doubt as to the correctness of Ricardo’s prophecy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an easy matter to reproach Ricardo<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> with his failure to foresee
the remarkable development in the methods of transport and
cheap importation which resulted in the arrest, if not the reversal, of
the upward movement of the rent curve. The complaints of landlords
both in England and Europe seem to belie the Ricardian theory.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
But who can tell whether the peril is finally removed or not?
The inevitable day will arrive when new countries will consume
the corn which to-day they export. This may not come about
in the history of England and Europe for some centuries yet,
but when it does happen, rent, instead of being stationary and
retrogressive, as it has been so long, will again resume its upward
trend.</p>

<p>It is true that we may reckon upon the aid of agricultural science
even if foreign importation should fail us. Ricardo was ever mindful
of the great possibilities of human industry. Other economists,
notably Carey and Fontenay, one of Bastiat’s disciples, have propounded
a theory which is the exact antithesis of the Ricardian,
namely, that human industry in its utilisation of natural forces
always begins with the feeblest as being more easily tamed, the more
powerful and recalcitrant forces only coming in for attention later
on. The earth is no exception to the rule, and agricultural industry
might well become not less but more productive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>This thesis, which implies a negation of the law of diminishing
returns, is based upon a very debatable analogy.</p>

<p>When speaking of the future of industry it is well to remember
that forces now seldom used, and perhaps seldom thought of, such
as the energies liberated by chemical and intermolecular action, may
hold infinite resources in reserve for mankind. But agriculture is
different. Admitting that with nitrogen got from the atmosphere, or
with phosphorus extracted from the subsoil, we may enrich the land
indefinitely, still we are continually confronted with the limitations
of time and space, which must determine the development of living
things, and of agricultural products among them. When albumen
can be scientifically produced then will the Ricardian theory become
obsolete. Until then it holds the field.</p>

<h5 id="heading16">2. <span class="smcap">Of Wages and Profits</span></h5>

<p>Let us now approach these two laws of Malthus and Ricardo—the
law of population and the law of rent—and ask what effect they
are likely to have upon the condition of the worker and the amount of
his wages. The answer is not very reassuring. On the one hand
there is an indefinite increase in the numbers of the proletariat—the
result of unchecked procreation, for “the moral restraint” can
hardly be said to have influence at all. The inevitable result is the
degradation of human labour. On the other hand, the law of
diminishing returns causes a continuous rise in the price of necessaries.
Between low wages on the one hand and high prices on the other, the
worker feels himself crushed as between the hammer and the anvil.</p>

<p>Turgot had long since given utterance to the tragic thought
that the wages of the worker are only just sufficient to keep him alive.
His contemporary Necker gave expression to the view in terms still
more melancholy. “Were it possible,” writes Necker, “to discover
a kind of food less agreeable than bread but having double its sustenance,
people would then be reduced to eating only once in two
days.” These must be looked upon as mere isolated statements,
sufficiently well attested by contemporary facts, perhaps, but laying
no claim to be considered general, permanent, and inevitable laws
such as Ricardo and Malthus would have regarded them.</p>

<p>And Ricardo still more emphatically declares that “the natural
price of labour is that price which is necessary to enable the labourers
one with another to subsist and to perpetuate their race without
either increase or diminution.” Note the last words, “without increase
or diminution”; that is, if a working man has more children
than are necessary for replacing their parents, then their wages will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
fall below the normal rate until increased mortality shall have again
established equilibrium.</p>

<p>This is not tantamount to saying that nominal wages measured in
terms of money cannot increase. Indeed, it is absolutely necessary
that they should increase, seeing that the price of commodities is
continually rising. If they were to remain the same the workman
would soon be reduced to starvation. Wages accordingly will show a
tendency to rise in sympathy with the rising price of corn, so that
the workman will always be able to procure just the same quantity
of bread, no more and no less. It is his real wages measured in
corn that remain stationary, and upon this depends the well-being
of the working class.</p>

<p>But do they really remain stationary? Ricardo does not seem
to think so. “In the natural advance of society the wages of labour
will have a tendency to fall, as far as they are regulated by supply
and demand; for the supply of labourers will continue to increase at
the same rate, whilst the demand for them will increase at a slower
rate.”<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>It is even possible that an increase in nominal wages may hide a
decrease in real wages. In that case, of course, wages will appear to
rise, but “the fate of the labourer will be less happy; he will receive
more money wages it is true, but his corn wages will be reduced.”
Only when the working classes are sufficiently thoughtful to limit
the number of their children will it be possible to hope for a preservation
of the <i>status quo</i>. “It is a truth which admits not a doubt, that the
comforts and well-being of the poor cannot be permanently secured
without some regard on their part or some effort on the part of the
legislature to regulate the increase of their numbers, and to render
less frequent among them early and improvident marriages.”</p>

<p>In other words, there will always be a demand for a certain number
of individuals in order to supply the needs of industry. So long as
this indispensable minimum is not exceeded the wages even of the
very lowest order must be sufficient to maintain existence, for they
must all be kept alive at any rate. But should the working population
exceed this demand nothing can prevent wages falling even
below the minimum necessary for existence, for there will no longer
be any necessity for keeping them all alive.</p>

<p>It must be remarked here that on this question, as on that of
rent, Malthus is less pessimistic than Ricardo. Far from maintaining
that every rise in wages of necessity involves an excess of population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and a consequent lowering of wages, Malthus believed that a
capacity for forethought, which constitutes the most efficacious check
upon the operation of blind instinct, may be engendered even among
the working classes, and that a high standard of life once secured
may become permanent. All this may be very true, but the
reasoning involves us in a vicious circle. In order that a high rate of
wages may produce its beneficial effects it must first of all be established,
but how can it possibly be established as long as the working
classes remain steeped in the misery caused by not exercising this
forethought?</p>

<p>An exit from the circle is only possible by recalling the fact that
the market wage incessantly oscillates about the natural wage
according to the exigencies of demand and supply. If this accidental
rise could be prolonged a little it might become permanent and
modify the workman’s standard of life.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Such is the law of wages, which has long since passed into an
axiom, and whose authority is invoked in every discussion on social
reform. To every socialistic scheme, to every proposal for social
reform, there is always one answer: “There is no means of improving
the lot of the worker except by limiting the number of his
children. His destiny is in his own hands.”<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Latter-day socialism,
commencing with Lassalle, makes a careful study of the law, and
returns to the charge against the existing economic order by affirming
that in no respect is it a natural law, but merely a result of the
capitalist <i>régime</i>, upon which it supplies an eloquent commentary.</p>

<p>We must not fail to note that in the Ricardian theory there is
not what we can exactly call antagonism between the landed proprietor
and the proletarian. To the latter it is a matter of indifference
whether rents be high or low, for his money wages move
in sympathy with the price of corn, but his real wages never change.
The proprietor on his side is equally indifferent to rising or falling
wages, for they never affect his receipts. His rent, as a matter of
fact, is determined by the quantity of labour employed on the
least fertile lands, but this quantity of labour has nothing to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the rate of wages. The landlords are the grandees of a different
order.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>The real struggle lies between capitalist and worker. Once the
value of corn has been determined by the cost of producing it on
the least favoured land, the proprietor seizes whatever is over and
above this, saying to both worker and capitalist, “You can divide the
rest between you.” This clearly is Ricardo’s view.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> “Whatever
raises the wages of labour lowers the profits of stock.” Wages can
only rise at the expense of profits, and <i>vice versa</i>—a terrible prophecy
that has been abundantly illustrated by the fortunes of the labour
movement, but never more clearly than at the present moment.</p>

<p>But the mere statement of the fatal antagonism between capitalist
and workman must have caused both grief and surprise to those
economists who had endeavoured to demonstrate the solidarity of
interests between them as between brothers. Bastiat was one of
these, and he tried to show that in the course of economic evolution
the share of each factor tends to grow, but that labour’s shows the
greatest increase.</p>

<p>There can be no objection to Ricardo’s method of stating the
law. The whole thing is so evident that it is almost a truism. A
cake is being shared between two persons. If one gets more than
his due share is it not evident that the other must get less? It may
be pointed out, on the other hand, that the amount available for
distribution is continually on the increase, so that the share which
each participant gets may really be growing bigger. But that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
hardly the problem to be solved.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Increase the cake tenfold, even
a hundredfold, but if one person gets more than half of it the other
must have less. Ricardo’s implication is just that. His law deals
with proportions and not with quantities.</p>

<p>Admitting that the proportion which one of the two factors
receives can be increased only if the other is lessened, the problem is
to discover which of the two, capital or labour, has the bigger
portion. It really seems as if it were labour, for Ricardo speaks
of another law of profits, namely, “the tendency of profits to a
minimum.” Here is another thesis which has had a long career in the
history of economics, but what are the reasons that can be adduced in
support of it? The natural tendency of profits, then, is to fall; “for
in the progress of society and wealth the additional quantity of food
required is obtained by the sacrifice of more labour.” It is determined
by the same cause as determined rent—the system is a solid
piece of work at any rate.</p>

<p>But how does the cultivation of inferior land affect the rate of
profits? We have already seen how the worker’s share, the minimum
necessary for keeping body and soul together, goes to swell the high
price of corn.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> But the manufacturer cannot transfer the cost of
high wages to the consumer, for the rate of wages has no effect on
prices. (Labour has, but wages have none.) As a consequence,
the capitalist’s share must be correspondingly reduced. We must
remember that the workman gains nothing by the high rate of
wages, for his consumption of food is limited by nature, but this does
not hinder the capitalist losing a great deal by it.</p>

<p>And so there must come a time when the necessary wage will
have absorbed everything and nothing will remain for profit. There
will be a new era in history, for every incentive to accumulate capital
will disappear with the extinction of profit. Capital will cease
growing, no new lands will be cultivated, and population will be
brought to a sudden standstill.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The stationary state with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
melancholy vistas will be entered upon. Mill has described it in such
eloquent terms that we are almost reconciled to the prospect. But
it could hardly have been a pleasant matter for Ricardo, who was
primarily a financier and had but little concern with philosophy. He
was very much attached to his prophecies, and there is a delicate
piece of irony in the thought that the tendency of profits towards a
minimum should have been first noted by this great representative of
capitalism. At the same time he felt a little reassured when he
thought of the opposing forces which might check its downward
trend and arrest the progress of rent. In both instances the best
corrective seemed to lie in the freedom of foreign trade.</p>

<p>The general lines of distribution are presented to us in a strikingly
simple fashion. The demonstration is neater even than the famous
<i>Tableau économique</i>, and it has the further merit of being nearer
the actual facts as they appeared in Ricardo’s day, for they are no
longer quite the same. It may be represented by means of a diagram
consisting of three lines.</p>

<p>At the top is an ascending line representing rent—the share of
Mother Earth. The proprietor’s rent reveals a double increase both
of money and kind, for as population and its needs grow it requires
an increasing quantity of corn at an increased price. Still, the high
price cannot be indefinitely prolonged, for beyond a certain point a
high price of corn would arrest the growth of population and at the
same time the growth of rent; then it would no longer be necessary
to cultivate new lands.</p>

<p>In the middle is a horizontal line representing wages—labour’s
share. The real wages of labour remain stationary, for it simply
receives the quantity of corn necessary to keep it alive. It is true
that as the corn is gradually becoming dearer the worker’s nominal
wages increase, but with no real benefit to him.</p>

<p>Below this is a descending line representing profits—capital’s
share.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> It shows a downward trend for the simple reason that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
finds itself squeezed between the proprietor’s share, which tends to
increase, and the labourer’s, which is stationary. The capitalist is
brought to our notice in the guise of an English farmer who is obliged
to raise his servants’ wages as the corn becomes dearer, but who
gains nothing by this rise because the extra revenue is taken by the
proprietor in the form of higher rent. But profits cannot fall indefinitely,
for beyond a certain point it would involve an end to the
employment of old capital and the formation of new capital. This
would hinder the cultivation of new lands, and would arrest the high
price of corn and lower rent.</p>

<h5 id="heading17">3. <span class="smcap">The Balance of Trade Theory and the Quantity
Theory of Money</span></h5>

<p>Such are the more characteristic of Ricardo’s doctrines—at any
rate, those that left the deepest impression upon his successors and
caused the greatest stir among his contemporaries. There are other
doctrines besides which, regarded as contributions to the science,
are much more important and more definite; but just because they
figured almost directly in the category of universally accepted truths
whose validity and authorship have never been questioned they
have contributed less to his fame. Such are his theories of international
trade and banking, where the theorist becomes linked to a
first-rate practical genius. Here at any rate there is no note of
pessimism and no suggestion of conflicting interests. On the contrary,
he was able to point out that “under a system of perfectly free
commerce the pursuit of individual advantage is admirably connected
with the universal good of the whole.”</p>

<p>In the matter of international trade he showed himself a more
resolute Free Trader than either Smith or the Physiocrats. It seemed
to him that the only way of arresting the terrible progress of rent
and of checking the rising price of corn and the downward tendency
of profits was by the freest importation of foreign corn.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>In addition to this twofold argument in favour of Free Trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Ricardo brings forward another which is of considerable importance
even at the present time. This argument is based upon the advantages
which accrue from the territorial division of labour. “By
stimulating industry, by rewarding ingenuity, and by using most
efficaciously the peculiar powers bestowed by Nature, it distributes
labour most effectively and most economically.”</p>

<p>It may be worth while remarking that his illustrious contemporary
Malthus remained more or less of a Protectionist.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> It might seem
strange that Malthus, continually haunted as he was by the spectre
of famine, should refuse to welcome importation. But his point
of view was doubtless largely that of the modern agricultural Protectionist,
who believes that the surest way of preserving a country
from famine is not to abandon its agriculture to the throes of foreign
competition, but, on the contrary, to strengthen and develop the
home industry by securing it a sufficiently high price for its products.
We must also remember that Malthus’s theory of rent differed somewhat
from Ricardo’s, and that he was not so violently opposed to
State intervention.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>But Ricardo’s principal contribution to the science was his discovery
of the laws governing the movements of commodities and
the counter-movements of money from one place to another, and the
admirable demonstration which he has given us of this remarkable
ebb and flow.</p>

<p>As soon as the balance of commerce becomes unfavourable to
France, let us say—that is, as soon as importation exceeds exportation
say by £1,000,000—money is exported to pay for this excessive
importation. Money becomes scarce, its value rises, and prices fall.
But a fall in price will check foreign importation and will encourage
exportation, so that imports will show signs of falling off while exports
will grow. Money will no longer be sent abroad, and the current
will begin to run the other way, until the £1,000,000 sent abroad is
returned again. Moreover, the £1,000,000 sent abroad will cause a
movement in the opposite direction—superabundance and a depreciation
in the value of money, high prices, a premium on importation
and a check upon exportation. Accordingly economic forces on
both sides will conspire to bring back the balance of commerce to a
position of equilibrium—that is, to that position where each country
will possess just the quantity of money that it needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>It might be pointed out, on the other hand, that this somewhat
complicated mechanism can only operate very slowly, and that
considerable time must elapse before the prices of goods begin to
respond to the change in the quantity of money. But as a matter of
fact it is not necessary to wait until this phenomenon becomes
established, for another striking feature precedes it and announces
its approach so to speak, and this is, as Smith had already noted, a
change in the value of bills drawn on foreign countries. The foreign
exchanges are so sensitive that the slightest rise is enough to stimulate
exportation and to check importation.</p>

<p>Accordingly money seldom leaves a country, or only leaves it for
a short time. In other words, contrary to the generally accepted
opinion, silver and gold in international trade do little more than
oil the wheels of commerce. The trade is carried on as if the
metals were non-existent. In short, it is essentially of the nature
of barter.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>The explanation is very schematic. Every incidental phenomenon
is omitted, and the whole theory implies the validity of the quantity
theory of money, which is now open to considerable criticism as being
altogether inadequate for an explanation of the facts involved. But
this theory of the automatic regulation of the balance of trade by
means of variations in the value of money, although already hinted
at by Hume and Smith, is none the less a discovery of the first order,
and one that has done service as a working hypothesis for a whole
century.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>Its explanation turns upon a particular theory of international
trade which we can only mention in passing, but which we shall find
more fully developed in Stuart Mill’s theory of international values.</p>

<h5 id="heading18">4. <span class="smcap">Paper Money, its Issue and Regulation</span></h5>

<p>The enunciation of the principles which should govern the conduct
of bankers in issuing paper money is another debt that we owe to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
genius of Ricardo. The Bank Act of 1822, and that of 1844 especially,
which laid down the future policy of the Bank of England, represent
an attempt on the part of the Government to put his principles into
practice.</p>

<p>Ricardo was an eye-witness of the great panic of February 26,
1797, when the reserves of the Bank of England fell from ten millions
to a million and a half, necessitating an Order in Council suspending
cash payments. The suspension, which was supposed to be a
temporary expedient, extended right up to 1821. The depreciation
in the value of the bank-note averaged about 10 per cent., but at
one period towards the end of the Napoleonic wars it rose as high
as 30 per cent. He also witnessed the suffering which such depreciation
caused. Landlords demanded the payment of their rents
in gold, or claimed an increase in the rent equal to the fall in the
value of the note.</p>

<p>Ricardo tried to unravel the causes of this depreciation in his
pamphlet entitled <i>The High Price of Bullion</i>, published in 1809,
and came to the conclusion that there was only one cause, namely,
an excessive supply of paper. At this distance of time it might not
be thought such an extraordinary discovery after all. Still, he had
the greatest difficulty in getting people to admit this, and in refuting
the absurd explanations which had previously been suggested. He
showed how a depreciation in the value of the note necessarily resulted
in the exportation of gold, although most of his contemporaries, on
the contrary, believed that the exportation of gold was the cause of
all the mischief which they sought to check by an Act of Parliament.
“The remedy which I propose for all the evils in our currency is
that the Bank should gradually decrease the amount of their notes
in circulation until they shall have rendered the remainder of equal
value with the coins which they represent, or in other words till the
prices of gold and silver bullion shall be brought down to their Mint
price.”<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>But if that is the case why not cut the Gordian knot and suppress
paper money altogether? The reply shows how well Ricardo had
studied Smith: “A well-regulated paper currency is so great an
improvement in commerce that I should greatly regret if prejudice
should induce us to return to a system of less utility.” “The introduction
of the precious metals for the purposes of money may with
truth be considered as one of the most important steps towards the
improvement of commerce and the arts of civilised life; but it is
no less true that with the advancement of knowledge and science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
we discover that it would be another improvement to banish them
again from the employment to which, during a less enlightened
period, they had been so advantageously applied.”<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Proceeding, he points out that where you have only metallic
money it might happen that the production of gold fails to keep
pace with the growth of population, in which case you have a rise
in the value of gold accompanied by a fall in prices. This danger
might be obviated by a careful issue of notes in accordance with
the demands of society. In short, Ricardo is so little disposed to
abandon the system of paper money and to return to the previous
system of metallic money that, on the contrary, he would prefer to
abolish the metallic system altogether, taking good care that paper
money did not become superabundant.</p>

<p>So convinced was he of the superiority of paper money that he
had no desire to see the Bank resume cash payment. The result of
the resumption would be a demand on the part of the public for a
conversion of their paper money, “and thus, to indulge a mere
caprice, a most expensive medium would be substituted for one of
little value.”</p>

<p>But if the notes are not convertible into cash, what is there to
guarantee their value or to regulate their issue and prevent depreciation?
This can be done merely by keeping a reserve of gold at the
bank, not necessarily in the form of money, but in the form of ingots.
The bank would not be allowed to issue any notes beyond the value
of these ingots. This regulation would have the effect of keeping
the value of the note at par, for bankers and money-dealers would
immediately proceed to convert these notes into gold as soon as
they showed any signs of depreciation. This would not mean,
however, that the public at large would again return to the use
of metallic money, for these ingots would be of little use for purposes
of everyday life.</p>

<p>It is a curious system. One would hardly expect the great
champion of Liberal political economy to outline a banking system
which could only operate through a State bank. This was clearly
his opinion, however. He declared himself utterly opposed to the
free banking system, and doubted the ability of such a system to
regulate the currency. “In that sense there can be no excess
whilst the bank does not pay in specie, because the commerce of the
country can easily employ and absorb any sum which the bank may
send into circulation.”<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> This shows what little confidence a
Liberal individualist like Ricardo had in the liberty of individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and their ability to judge of the kind of money that is most serviceable.</p>

<p class="tb">Ricardo’s disciples are legion, and among them is every economist
of standing of the earlier part of the nineteenth century. The
best known among these are the three writers who immediately
follow him in chronological order: James Mill, the father of John
Stuart Mill (<i>Elements of Political Economy</i>, 1821), his friend McCulloch
(<i>Principles of Political Economy</i>, 1825), and Nassau Senior (<i>Political
Economy</i>, 1836).</p>

<p>The two first-named writers contented themselves with a vigorous
defence of the master’s views without contributing anything very
new. We have already referred to the very different conclusions
which James Mill draws from the theory of rent, and how he became
an advocate of land nationalisation. McCulloch also was one of
the earliest advocates of the right to strike.</p>

<p>Senior deserves a few pages to himself, for his work in systematising
the Classical doctrines. We shall deal with him in our chapter
on John Stuart Mill.</p>

<h2 id="BOOK_II_THE_ANTAGONISTS">BOOK II: THE ANTAGONISTS</h2>

<p>With the completion of the work of Say, Malthus, and Ricardo it
really seemed as if the science of political economy was at last
definitely constituted.</p>

<p>It would, of course, be extravagant to imagine that these three
writers were unanimous on all questions. There were several points
that still remained obscure, and more than one theory that was
open to discussion. Despite its apparent rigidity, it would not have
required much critical ability to detect flaws in the symmetrical
doctrine so recently elaborated and to predict its ultimate discredit.</p>

<p>Hardly, indeed, was their task completed before the new doctrine
found itself subjected to a most formidable attack, which was
simultaneously directed against it from all points of the compass.
The criticisms and objections advanced against the new science of
political economy form the subject-matter of this second book.</p>

<p>First comes Sismondi, a purely critical mind, with a haunting
catalogue of the sufferings and miseries resulting from free competition.
Spirits still more daring will essay the discovery of new principles
of social organisation. The Saint-Simonians will demand
the suppression of private property, the extinction of inheritance, and
the centralised control of industry by the arm of an omniscient
government. The voluntary socialists—Owen, Fourier, Louis Blanc—will
claim the substitution of voluntary co-operation for personal
interest. Proudhon will dream of the reconciliation of liberty
and justice in a perfect system of exchange from which money shall
be excluded. Finally, the broad cosmopolitanism of the Classical
writers is to find a formidable antagonist in Friedrich List, and a
new Protectionism, based on the sentiment of nationality, is to
regild the old Mercantilism which seemed so hopelessly battered
under the blows of Adam Smith and the Physiocrats.</p>

<p>These very diverse doctrines, along with much that is fanciful and
erroneous, contain many just ideas, many original conceptions.
They never succeeded in supplanting the doctrine of the founders;
but they demonstrated, once for all, that the science, apparently complete,
was in reality far from perfection. To the Orthodox school
they flung the taunt which Hamlet cast at Horatius: “There
are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your
philosophy.” In this way fruitful discussions were frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
raised, and the public proved sympathetic listeners. The economists
who were still faithful to the Classical creed began to doubt the
validity of their deductions and were forced to modify their methods
and to overhaul their conclusions.</p>

<p>Let us now attempt to realise the importance of the part which
these critics played.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I_SISMONDI_AND_THE_ORIGINS">CHAPTER I: SISMONDI AND THE ORIGINS
OF THE CRITICAL SCHOOL</h3>

<p>The first thirty years of the nineteenth century witnessed profound
transformations in the structure of the economic world.</p>

<p>Economic Liberalism had everywhere become triumphant.
In France the corporation era was definitely at an end by 1791.
Some manufacturers, it is true, demanded its re-establishment
under the First Empire; but they were disappointed, and their
demands were never re-echoed. In England the last trace of the
Statute of Apprentices, that shattered monument of the Parliamentary
<i>régime</i>, was removed from the Statute Book in 1814.
Nothing remained which could possibly check the advent of <i>laissez-faire</i>.
Free competition became universal. The State renounced
all rights of interference either with the organisation of production
or with the relations between masters and men, save always the right
of prohibiting combinations in restraint of trade, and this restriction
was upheld with a view to giving free play to the law of demand and
supply. In France the Penal Code of the Empire proved as tyrannous
as the old <i>régime</i> or the Revolution; and although freedom of
combination was granted in England by an Act of 1825, the defined
limits were so narrow that the privilege proved quite illusory. The
general opinion of the English legislator is well expressed in the
report of a Commission appointed by the House of Commons in
1810, quoted by Mr. and Mrs. Webb.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> “No interference of the
legislature with the freedom of trade, or with the perfect liberty of
every individual to dispose of his time and of his labour in the way
and on the terms which he may judge most conducive to his own
interest, can take place without violating general principles of the
first importance to the prosperity and happiness of the community.”
In both countries—in England as well as in France—a <i>régime</i> of
individual contract was introduced into industry, and no legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
intervention was allowed to limit this liberty—a liberty, however,
which really existed only on the side of the employers.</p>

<p>Under this <i>régime</i> the new manufacturing industry, born of
many inventions, was wonderfully developed. In Great Britain
Manchester, Birmingham, and Glasgow, in France Lille, Sedan,
Rouen, Elbeuf, Mulhouse, became the chosen centres of large-scale
production.</p>

<p>Alongside of these brilliant successes we have two new phenomena
which were bound to draw the attention of observers and to
invite the reflection of the thoughtful. First we have the concentration
in the great centres of wealth of a new and miserable class—the
workers; and, secondly, we have the phenomenon of over-production.</p>

<p>Factory life during the earlier half of the nineteenth century
has been the subject of countless treatises, and attention has frequently
been drawn to the practice of employing children of all ages
under circumstances that were almost always unhealthy and often
cruel,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> to the habit of prolonging the working day indefinitely, to
the inadequate wages paid, to the general ignorance and coarseness
of the workers, as well as to the deformities and vices which resulted
under such unnatural conditions. In England, medical reports,
House of Commons inquiries, and the speeches and publications of
Owen aroused the indignation of the public, and in 1819 an Act
of Parliament was passed limiting the hours of work of children in
cotton factories. This, the first rudiment of factory legislation,
was to be considerably extended during the course of the century.
J. B. Say, who in 1815 was travelling in England, declared that a
worker with a family, despite efforts often of an heroic character,
could not gain more than three-quarters and sometimes only a half
of what was needed for his upkeep.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>In France we must wait until 1840 to find in the great work of
Dr. Villermé a complete description of the heartrending life of the
workers and the martyrdom of their children. Here, for example,
we learn that “in some establishments in Normandy the thong
used for the punishment of children in the spinner’s trade appears
as an instrument of production.”<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Even before this, in an inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
into the state of the cotton industry in 1828, the Mulhouse masters
expressed their belief that the growing generation was gradually
becoming enervated under the influence of the exhaustive toil of a
day of thirteen or fifteen hours.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The <i>Bulletin</i> of the Industrial
Society of Mulhouse of the same year states that in Alsace, among
other places, the general working day averaged from fifteen to
sixteen hours, and sometimes extended even to seventeen hours.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
And all evidence goes to show that things were equally bad, if not
worse, in other industrial towns.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Crises supplied phenomena no less disquieting than the sufferings
of the proletariat. In 1815 a first crisis shook the English market,
throwing a number of workmen on to the street and resulting in
riots and machine-breaking. It arose from an error of the English
manufacturers, who during the war period had been forced to
accumulate the stocks which they could not export, so that on the
return of peace their supplies far exceeded the demands of the
Continent. In 1818 a new commercial panic, followed by fresh
riots, again paralysed the English market. In 1825 a third and more
serious crisis, begot probably of the extensive credit given to the
newly opened markets of South America, caused the failure of about
seventy English provincial banks, bringing much ruin in its train,
as well as a shock to several neighbouring countries. During the
whole of the nineteenth century similar phenomena have recurred
with striking regularity, involving ruin to ever-widening areas, as
production on a large scale has extended its sway. No wonder some
people were driven to inquire whether the economic system beneath
all its superficial grandeur did not conceal some lurking flaw or
whether these successive shocks were merely the ransom of industrial
progress.</p>

<p>Poverty and economic crises were the two new facts that attracted
immediate attention in those countries where economic liberty had
secured its earliest triumphs; and no longer could attention be
diverted from them. Henceforth they were incessantly employed
by writers of the most various schools as weapons against the new
<i>régime</i>. In many minds they gradually engendered a want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
confidence in the doctrines of Adam Smith. With some philanthropic
and Christian writers they provoked sentimental indignation and
aroused the vehement protest of humanity against an implacable
industrialism which was the source of so much misery and ruin.
With others, especially with the socialists, who pushed criticism to
much greater lengths, even to an examination of the institution of
private property itself, they resulted in a demand for the complete
overthrow of society. All critics whatsoever rejected the idea of a
spontaneous harmony between private and public interests as being
incompatible with the circumstances which we have just mentioned.</p>

<p>Among such writers no one has upheld the testimony of these
facts more strongly than Sismondi.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> All his interest in political
economy, so far as theory was concerned, was summed up in the
explanation of crises, so far as practice, in the amelioration of the
condition of the workers. No one has sought the explanation or
striven for the remedy with greater sincerity. He is thus the chief
of a line of economists whose works never ceased to exercise influence
throughout the whole of the nineteenth century, and who, without
being socialists on the one hand or totally blind to the vices of
<i>laissez-faire</i> on the other, sought that happy mean which permits
of the correction of the abuses of liberty while retaining the principle.
The first to give sentiment a prominent place in his theory,
his work aroused considerable enthusiasm at the time, but was
subjected to much criticism at a later period.</p>

<h4 id="heading19">I: THE AIM AND METHOD OF POLITICAL ECONOMY</h4>

<p>Sismondi began his career as an ardent supporter of economic
Liberalism. In 1803, the year that witnessed the production of
Say’s treatise, he published an exposition of the ideas of Adam
Smith in a book entitled <i>La Richesse commerciale</i>, a volume which
achieved a certain measure of success. During the following years
he devoted himself to work exclusively historical, literary, or
political, and he only returned to the study of political economy
in 1818. “At this period,” he writes, “I was keenly interested in
the commercial crises which Europe had experienced during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
past years, and in the cruel sufferings of the factory hands, which
I myself had witnessed in Italy, Switzerland, and France; and which,
according to public reports, were at least equally bad in England,
Belgium, and Germany.”<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> It was at this moment that he was asked
to write an article on political economy for the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopædia</i>.
Upon a re-examination of his ideas in the light of these new
facts he found to his surprise that his conclusions differed entirely
from those of Adam Smith. In 1819 he travelled in England,
“that wonderful country, which seems to have undergone a great
experience in order to teach the rest of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> This seemed
to confirm his first impressions. He took the article which he had
contributed to the <i>Encyclopædia</i> and developed it. From this work
sprang the treatise which appeared in 1819 under the significant
title of <i>Nouveaux Principes d’Économie politique</i> and made him
celebrated as an economist. His path was already clear. His
want of agreement with the predominant school in France and
England was further emphasised by the appearance of his studies
in economics,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> in which he illustrates and confirms the ideas already
expounded in the <i>Nouveaux Principes</i> by means of a great number
of descriptive and historical studies bearing more especially upon
the condition of the agriculturists in England, Scotland, Ireland,
and Italy.</p>

<p>Sismondi’s disagreement was not upon the theoretical principles
of political economy. So far as these were concerned he declared
himself a disciple of Adam Smith.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> He merely disagreed with the
method, the aim, and the practical conclusions of the Classical
school. We will examine his arguments on each of these points.</p>

<p>First of all as regards method. He draws an important distinction
between Smith and his followers, Ricardo and J. B. Say.
“Smith,” says he, “attempted to study every fact in the light of
its own social environment,” and “his immortal work is, indeed,
the outcome of a philosophic study of the history of mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Towards Ricardo, who is accused of having introduced the abstract
method into the science, his attitude is quite different, and much as
he admired Malthus, who, “possessed of a singularly forceful and
penetrative mind, had cultivated the habit of a conscientious study
of facts,”<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> still his spirit shrank from admitting those abstractions
which Ricardo and his disciples demanded from him.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Political
economy, he thought, was best treated as a “moral science where all
facts are interwoven and where a false step is taken whenever
one single fact is isolated and attention is concentrated upon
it alone.”<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The science was to be based on experience, upon
history and observation. Human conditions were to be studied
in detail. Allowance was to be made for the period in which a man
lived, the country he inhabited, and the profession he followed,
if the individual was to be clearly visualised and the influence
of economic institutions upon him successfully traced. “I am
convinced,” says he, “that serious mistakes have ensued from
the too frequent generalisations which have been made in social
science.”<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>This criticism was levelled not only at Ricardo and McCulloch,
but it also included J. B. Say within its purview, for Say had treated
political economy as an exposition of a few general principles. It
also prepared the way for that conception of political economy
upon the discovery of which the German Historical school so prided
itself at a later date. Sismondi, himself an historian and a publicist
interested in immediate reforms, could not fail to see quite clearly
the effects that social institutions and political organisation were
bound to have upon economic prosperity. A good illustration of
his method is furnished by his treatment of the probable effects of
a complete abolition of the English Corn Laws. The question, he
remarks, could not be decided by theoretical arguments alone
without taking some account of the various methods of cultivating
the soil. A country of tenant farmers such as England would find it
difficult to meet the competition of feudal countries such as Poland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
or Russia, where corn only costs the proprietor “a few hundred
lashes judiciously bestowed upon the peasants.”<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi’s conception of economic method is incontestably
just so long as the economist confines himself to the discussion of
practical problems or attempts to gauge the probable effects of a
particular legislative reform or is unravelling the causes of a particular
event. But should the economist wish to picture to himself
the general aspect of the economic world, he cannot afford to neglect
the abstract method, and Sismondi himself was forced to have
recourse to it. It is true that he used it with considerable awkwardness,
and his failure to construct or to discuss abstract theories
perhaps explains his preference for the other method. At any rate
it does partly explain the keen opposition which his book aroused
among the partisans of what he was the first to call by the happy title
of the “Orthodox” school.</p>

<p>But to imagine anything more confused than the reasonings
by which he attempts to demonstrate the possibility of a general
crisis of over-production is difficult.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> For his point of departure he
takes the distinction between the annual revenue and the annual
production of a country. According to him the revenue of one
year pays for the production of the following.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Accordingly, if the
production of any one year exceeds the revenue of the previous year
a portion of the produce will remain unsold and producers will be
ruined. Sismondi reasons as if the nation were composed of agriculturists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
who buy the manufactured goods they need with the
revenue received from the sale of the present year’s crop. Consequently
if manufactured products are superabundant, the agricultural
revenue will not be enough to pay a sufficient price.</p>

<p>But within the argument there lurks a twofold confusion. At
bottom a nation’s annual revenue is its annual produce, and the one
cannot be less than the other. Moreover, it is not the produce of two
different years that is exchanged, but the various products of the
same year, or rather (for this subdivision of the movements of the
economic world into annual periods has no counterpart in actual
life) it is the different products created at every moment that are
being continually exchanged, thus constituting a reciprocal demand
for one another. At any one moment there may be too many or
too few products of a certain kind, resulting in a severe crisis in one
or more industries. But of every product, at one and the same
time, there can never be too much. McCulloch, Ricardo, and Say
victoriously upheld this view against Sismondi.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>It is not only on the question of method, but still more on the
question of aim, that Sismondi finds himself in opposition to the
Classical school. To them political economy was the science
of wealth, or chrematistics, as Aristotle called it. But the real object
of the science should be man, or at least the physical well-being of
man. To consider wealth by itself and to forget man was a sure
way of making a false start.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> This is why he gave such prominence
to a theory of distribution alongside of the theory of production,
which had received the exclusive attention of the Classical writers.
The Classical school, it is true, might have retorted that they gave
first place to production because the multiplication of products<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
was a <i>sine qua non</i> of all progress in distribution. But Sismondi
regarded it otherwise. Wealth only deserves the name when it is
proportionately distributed. He could not conceive of an abstract
treatment of distribution, and consequently could not appreciate it.
In his own treatment of distribution he devoted a special section to
the “poor,” who live by their labour and toil from morn till eve in
field or workshop. They form the bulk of our population, and the
changes wrought in their way of life by the invention of machinery,
the freedom of competition, and the <i>régime</i> of private property was
what interested him most. “Political economy at its widest,”
he says, “is a theory of charity, and any theory that upon last
analysis has not the result of increasing the happiness of mankind
does not belong to the science at all.”<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>What really interested Sismondi was not so much what is called
political economy, but what has since become known as <i>économie
sociale</i> in France and <i>Sozialpolitik</i> in Germany. His originality,
so far as the history of doctrines is concerned, consisted in his having
originated this study. J. B. Say scorned his definitions, so different
were they from his own. “M. de Sismondi refers to political
economy as the science charged with guarding the happiness of
mankind. What he wishes to say is that it is the science a knowledge
of which ought to be possessed by all those who are concerned
with human welfare. Rulers who wish to be worthy of their positions
ought to be acquainted with the study, but the happiness of mankind
would be much jeopardised if, instead of trusting to the intelligence
and industry of the ordinary citizen, we trusted to governments.”<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
And he adds: “The greater number of German writers, by following
the false notions spread by the Colbertian system, have come to
regard political economy as being purely a science of administration.”</p>

<h4 id="heading20">II: SISMONDI’S CRITICISM OF OVER-PRODUCTION
AND COMPETITION</h4>

<p>Deceived as to the best method to follow, mistaken in its
conception of the nature of the object to be kept in view, it is not
surprising that the “Chrematistic school” should have gone astray
in its practical conclusions. The teaching of the school gave an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
undoubted incentive to unlimited production, for it was loud in its
praise of free competition. It preached the doctrine of harmony of
interests, and considered that the best form of government was no
government at all. These were the three essential points to which
Sismondi took exception.</p>

<p>First as regards its immoderate enthusiasm for production.
According to the Classical writers, the general growth of production
presented no inconvenience, thanks to that spontaneous
mechanism which immediately corrected the errors of the <i>entrepreneur</i>
if he in any way under-estimated the necessities of demand. Falling
prices warned him against a false step and influenced him in
directing his efforts towards other ends. In a similar way rising
prices proved to the producers that supplies were insufficient and
that more must be manufactured. Hence the evils committed
would always be momentary and transient.</p>

<p>To this Sismondi replied: If instead of reasoning in this abstract
fashion economists had considered the facts in detail, if instead of
paying attention to products they had shown some regard for man,
they would not have so light-heartedly supported the producers in
their errors. An increased supply, if supply were already insufficient
to meet a growing demand, would injure no one, but would be
profitable for all. That is true. But the restriction of an over-abundant
supply when the needs grow at a less rapid rate is not so
easily accomplished. Does anyone think that capital and labour
could on the morrow, so to speak, leave a declining industry in order
to engage in another? The worker cannot quickly leave the work
he lives by, to which he has served a long and costly apprenticeship,
and wherein he is distinguished for a professional skill that will be
lost elsewhere. Rather than consent to leave it, he will let his wages
fall, he will prolong the working day, remaining at work for fourteen
hours, and will toil during those hours that would otherwise be spent
in pleasure or debauchery; so that the produce raised by the same
number of workmen will be very much increased.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> As for the manufacturer,
he will not be less loath than the worker to quit an industry
into the management and construction of which he has put half or
even three-quarters of his fortune. Fixed capital cannot be transferred
from one use to another, for even the manufacturer is bound by
custom—a moral force whose strength is not easily calculated.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Like
the worker, he is tied to the industry which he has created and from
which he draws a living. Consequently production, far from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
spontaneously restrained, will remain the same or will even perhaps
tend to increase. In the end, however, he must yield, and adaptation
will take place, but only after much ruin. “Producers will not
withdraw from that industry entirely, and their numbers will
diminish only when some of the workshops have failed and a number
of workmen have died of misery.” “Let us beware,” says he in
conclusion, “of this dangerous theory of equilibrium which is supposed
to be automatically established. A certain kind of equilibrium,
it is true, is re-established in the long run, but it is only after a
frightful amount of suffering.”<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The dictum which was to some
extent true in Sismondi’s day controls the policy of every trust and
<i>Kartel</i> of the present day.</p>

<p>Nowadays production chiefly grows as the result of the multiplication
of machinery, and Sismondi’s most telling attacks were
directed against machinery. Consequently he has been regarded
as a reactionary and treated as an ignoramus, and for half a century
was refused a place among the economists.</p>

<p>On the question of machinery the Classical writers were unanimous.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
Machinery they considered to be very beneficial, furnishing
commodities at reduced rates and setting free a portion of the consumer’s
revenue, which accordingly meant an increased demand for
other products and employment for those dismissed as a result
of this introduction. Sismondi does not deny that theoretically
equilibrium is in the long run re-established. “Every new product
must in the long run give rise to some fresh consumption. But let
us examine things as they really are. Let us desist from our habit
of making abstraction of time and place. Let us take some account
of the obstacles and the friction of the social mechanism. And
what do we see? The immediate effect of machinery is to throw
some of the workers out of employment, to increase the competition
of others, and so to lower the wages of all. This results in diminished
consumption and a slackening of demand. Far from being always
beneficial, machinery produces useful results only when its introduction
is preceded by an increased revenue, and consequently by
the possibility of giving new work to those displaced. No one will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
deny the advantage of substituting a machine for a man, provided
that man can obtain employment elsewhere.”<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>Neither Ricardo nor Say denies this; they affirmed that the
effect of machinery is just to create some part of this demand for
labour. But Sismondi’s argument is vitiated by the same false idea
that, as we have seen above, made him admit the possibility of
general over-production—the idea that increased production, if it is
going to be useful, must always be preceded by increased demand.
He was unwilling to admit that the growth of production itself created
this demand. On the other hand, what is true in Sismondi’s attitude—and
we cannot insist too much on this—is the protest he makes
against the indifference of the Classical school in the face of the evils
of these periods of transition.</p>

<p>The Classical school regarded the miseries created by large-scale
production with that sang-froid which was to characterise the followers
of Marx amid the throes of the “inevitable Revolution.”
Among many similarities which may be pointed out between the writings
of Marx and the doctrines of the Classical school, this is one of the
most characteristic. The grandeur of the new <i>régime</i> is worthy of some
sacrifice. But Sismondi was an historian. His interest lay primarily in
those periods of transition which formed the exit from one <i>régime</i> and
the entrance into another, and which involved so much suffering for
the innocent. He was anxious to mitigate the hardships in order that
the process of transition might be eased. Nothing can be more legitimate
than a claim of this kind. J. B. Say recognised its validity to a
certain extent, and this is precisely the <i>rôle</i> of social economics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Sismondi makes another remark which is no less just. What disgusted
him was not merely that workmen should be driven out by
machinery, but that the workers who were retained only had a
limited share of the benefits which they procured.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> For the Classical
school it was enough that workers and consumers should have a share
in the general cheapening of production. But Sismondi demanded
more. So long as toil is as laborious as it is to-day, is it not just that
the workman should benefit by the introduction of machinery in the
way of increased leisure? In the social system as at present existing,
owing to the competition among workers as the result of excessive
population, machinery does not increase leisure, but it rather
strengthens competition, diminishes wages, provokes a more intense
effort on the part of the workman, and forces him to extend his
working day. Here again Sismondi appears correct. We cannot
see why the consumer alone should reap all the profit of improved
machinery, which never benefits the workman unless it affects articles
which enter into his consumption. There would be nothing very
striking if the benefits of progress, at least during a short time, were
to be shared between consumer and worker just as to-day they are
shared between inventor, <i>entrepreneur</i>, and society. This idea is the
inspiring motive of certain trade unions to-day, which only accept a
new machine in exchange for less work and more pay.</p>

<p>Sismondi’s method when applied to production and machinery
leads to conclusions very different from those of the Classics. This
is also true of his treatment of competition.</p>

<p>Adam Smith had written: “In general, if any branch of trade,
or any division of labour, be advantageous to the public, the freer
and more general the competition it will always be the more so.”<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
Sismondi considered this doctrine false, and invoked two reasons of
unequal value in support of his view.</p>

<p>The first is a product of the inexact idea already mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
above, which regards any progress in production as useless unless
preceded by more intensive demand. Competition is beneficial if
it excites the <i>entrepreneur</i> to multiply products in response to an
increased demand. In the opposite case it is bad, for if consumption
be stationary, its only effect will be to enable the more adroit <i>entrepreneur</i>
or the more powerful capitalist to ruin his rivals by means of
cheap sales, thus attracting to himself their <i>clientèle</i>, but giving no
benefit to the public. This is the spectacle that in reality is too often
presented to us. The movements of our captains of industry are
directed, not by any concern for the presumed advantage of the
public, but solely with a view to increased profits.</p>

<p>Sismondi’s argument is open to the same objection as was made
above. Cheapened production dispenses with a portion of the income
formerly spent, and creates a demand for other products, thus
repairing the evil it has created. Concentration of industry gives
to society the same advantage as is afforded by machinery, and the
same arguments may be used in its defence.</p>

<p>But against competition Sismondi directs a still more serious argument.
Pursuit of cheapness, he remarks, has forced the <i>entrepreneur</i> to
economise not only in the matter of stuff, but also of men. Competition
has everywhere enticed women and children to bear the burden
of production instead of adults. Certain <i>entrepreneurs</i>, in order to
secure a maximum return from human energy, have enforced day
and night toil with only a scanty wage in return. What is the use
of cheapness achieved under such circumstances? The meagre
advantage enjoyed by the public is more than counterbalanced by
the loss of vigour and health experienced by the workers. Competition
impairs this most precious capital—the life-energy of the race.
He points to the workmen of Grenoble earning six or eight sous for
a day of fourteen hours, children of six and eight years working for
twelve or fourteen hours in factories “in an atmosphere loaded with
down and dust” and perishing of consumption before attaining the
age of twenty. He concludes that the creation of an unhappy and
a suffering class is too great a price to pay for an extension of
national commerce, and in an oft-quoted phrase he says, “The
earnings of an <i>entrepreneur</i> sometimes represent nothing but the
spoliation of the workmen. A profit is made not because the
industry produces much more than it costs, but because it fails to
give to the workman sufficient compensation for his toil. Such an
industry is a social evil.”<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>It is futile to deny the justice of the argument. When cheapness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
is only obtained at the cost of permanent deterioration in the health
of the workers, competition evidently is a producer of evil rather than
of good. The public interest is no less concerned with the preservation
of vital wealth than it is with facilitating the production of
material wealth. Sismondi showed that competition was a double-edged
sword, and in doing so he prepared the way for those who very
justly demand that the State should place limits upon its use and
prescribe rules for its employment.</p>

<p>We might be tempted to go farther and see in the passage just
cited an unreserved condemnation of profits even. That would
involve placing Sismondi among the socialists, and this is sometimes
done, although, as we think, wrongly.</p>

<p>In certain passages he doubtless expresses himself in a manner
similar to Owen, the Saint-Simonians, and Marx. Thus in his studies
on political economy we come across phrases such as the following:
“We might almost say that modern society lives at the expense of
the proletariat, seeing that it curtails the reward of his toil.”<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> And
elsewhere: “Spoliation indeed we have, for do we not find the rich
robbing the poor? They draw in their revenues from the fertile,
easily cultivated fields and wallow in their wealth, while the cultivator
who created that revenue is dying of hunger, never allowed
to enjoy any of it.”<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> We might even say that Sismondi enunciated
the theory of surplus value, which was worked out by Marx, when he
makes use of the term <i>mieux value</i>.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> But the similarity is simply a
matter of words. Sismondi, speaking of surplus value, means to
imply the value that is constantly growing or being created every
year in a progressive country, not by the effort of labour alone, but
by the joint operation of capital and labour.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Marx’s idea that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
labour alone created value, and that consequently profit and interest
constituted a theft, is entirely foreign to Sismondi. Sismondi,
indeed, recognised that the revenues of landed proprietors and
capitalists were due to efforts which they themselves had never put
forth. He rightly distinguished between the wages of labour and
the revenues of proprietors, but to him the latter were not less
legitimate than the former, for, says he, “the beneficiaries who enjoy
such revenues without making any corresponding effort have acquired
a permanent claim to them in virtue of toil undertaken at some
former period, which must have increased the productivity of labour.”<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
When Sismondi says that the worker is robbed he merely means to
say that <i>sometimes</i> the worker is insufficiently paid; in other words,
that he does not always receive enough remuneration to keep him
alive, and were it only for the sake of humanity that he ought
to be better paid. But he does not consider that appropriation by
proprietors or capitalists of a portion of the social product is in
itself unjust.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> His point of view is not unlike that adopted at a
later period by the German socialists when they sought to justify
their social policy.</p>

<p>But although Sismondi’s criticism does not amount to socialism,
he causes considerable consternation among Liberals by the telling
manner in which he shows the falsity of the theory affirmed by the
Physiocrats and demonstrated by Smith, namely the natural identity
of individual and general interests. It is true that Smith hesitated
to apply it except to production. But Sismondi’s peculiar merit lies
in the fact that he examined its content in relation to distribution.
Sismondi finds himself forced by mere examination of the facts to
dispute the very basis of economic Liberalism. Curiously enough,
he seems surprised at his own conclusions. <i>A priori</i> the theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
identity of interests appeared to him true, for does it not, in fact, rest
upon the two ideas, (1) that “each knows his own interest better
than an ignorant or a careless Government ever can,” and (2) that
“the sum of the interests of each equals the interests of all”?
“Both axioms are true.”<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Why then is the conclusion false?</p>

<p>Here we touch the central theme of Sismondi’s system, the
point where he leaves the purely economic ground to which the
Classical writers had stuck and approaches new territory—the
question of the distribution of property. Sismondi discovered the
explanation of the contradiction which exists between private and
general interests in the unequal distribution of property among
men and the resulting unequal strength of the contracting parties.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading21">III: THE DIVORCE OF LAND FROM LABOUR AS THE
CAUSE OF PAUPERISM AND OF CRISES</h4>

<p>Sismondi was the first writer to give expression to the belief that
industrial society tends to separate into two absolutely distinct
classes—those who work and those who possess, or, as he often put
it, the rich and the poor. Free competition hastens this separation,
causing the disappearance of the intermediate ranks and leaving only
the proletariat and the capitalist.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> “The intermediate classes,”
says he somewhere, “have all disappeared: the small proprietor and
the peasant farmer of the plain, the master craftsman, the small
manufacturer, and the village tradesmen, all have failed to withstand
the competition of those who control great industries. Society no
longer has any room save for the great capitalist and his hireling,
and we are witnessing the frightfully rapid growth of a hitherto unknown
class—of men who have absolutely no property.”<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> “We
are living under entirely new conditions of which as yet we have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
experience. All property tends to be divorced from every kind of
toil, and therein is the sign of danger.”<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>This law of the concentration of capital which plays such an
important <i>rôle</i> in the Marxian system, though true of industry, seems
hardly applicable to property, for a considerable concentration of
labour is not incompatible with a fairly even distribution of property.
It was a memorable exposition that Sismondi gave of this law,
showing how it wrought its ravages in agriculture, in industry, and
in commerce all at the same time. “The tillage of the 34,250,000
acres under cultivation in England was, in 1831, accomplished by
1,046,982 cultivators, and now it is expected that the number may
be still further reduced. Not only have all the small farmers been
reduced to the position of labourers, but a great number of the day
labourers have been forced to abandon field work altogether. The
industry of the towns has adopted the principle of amalgamation of
forces, and capital has been added to capital with a vigour greater
than that which has joined field unto field. The manufacturer with
a capital of £1000 was the first to disappear. Soon those who
worked with £10,000 were considered small—too small. They
were reduced to ruin and their places taken by larger employers.
To-day those who trade with a capital of £100,000 are considered
of an average size, and the day is not far distant when these will
have to face the competition of manufacturers with a capital of
£1,000,000. The refining mills of the Gironde dispensed with
millers; the cask mills of the Loire ruined the coopers; the building
of steamboats, of diligences, of omnibuses and railways with the aid
of vast capitals have replaced the unpretentious industries of the independent
boatman, carriage- or wagon-maker. Wealthy merchants
have entered the retail trade and have opened their immense shops
in the great capitals, where, in virtue of the improved means of
transit, they are able to offer their provisions even to consumers who
live at the very extremities of the empire. They are well on the
way towards suppressing the wholesale trader as well as the retail
dealer, and the petty shopkeeper of the provinces. The places of
these independent tradesmen will soon be taken over by clerks,
hirelings, and proletarians.”<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>And now for the consequences of such a condition of things. In
this opposition existing between these two social classes which
formerly lived together harmoniously we shall find an explanation
of the workman’s misery and of economic crises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The sufferings of workmen, whence do they spring, if not from the
fact that their numbers are in excess of the demand for their labour,
thus forcing them to be content with the first wage that is offered
them, even though it be opposed to their own interests and the
interest of the whole class?<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> But “whence the necessity of submitting
to these onerous conditions and of tolerating a burden that
is ever becoming heavier under pain of hunger and death?” The
explanation lies in the separation of property and toil.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Formerly
the workman, an independent artisan, could gauge his revenue and
limit his family accordingly, for population is always determined by
revenue.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Robbed of his belongings, all his revenue is to-day got
from the capitalist who employs him. Ignorant of the future demand
for his products, as well as of the quantity of labour that may be
necessary, he has no longer any excuse for exercising forethought,
and accordingly he discards it. Population grows or diminishes in
accordance with the will of the capitalist. “Let there be an increased
demand for labour and a sufficient wage offered it and workmen
will be born. If the demand fails, the workmen will perish.”<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>This theory of population and wages is really Smith’s, who tried
to prove that men, like commodities, extended or limited their
numbers according to the needs of production. Sismondi, rather
than accept it as a proof of the harmonious adaptation of demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to supply, emphasises the lamentable effects of the separation of
wealth from labour.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Smith and Sismondi both fell into the error of
Malthus and Ricardo, who imagined that high wages of necessity
increased population. To-day facts seem to show that a higher
standard of well-being, on the contrary, tends to limit it, and the
proletarians, who constitute the majority of the nation, can no
longer be treated as mere tools in the hands of the capitalists, to be
taken up or thrown aside according to fancy or interest.</p>

<p>What is true of industrial employees is no less true of the toilers
of the field. In this connection Sismondi introduces the celebrated
distinction between net and gross production which has occupied the
attention of many economists since then. If the peasants collectively
owned all the land they would at least of a certainty find both the
security and the support of their life in the soil. They would never
let the gross produce fall below what was sufficient to support them.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
But with great landed proprietors, and with the peasant transformed
into the agricultural labourer, things have changed. The large
proprietors have the net product only in view—that is, the difference
between the cost of production and the sale price. It matters little
to them if the gross produce is sacrificed for the sake of increasing the
net produce. Here you have land which, when well cultivated,
brings gross produce of the value of 1000 shillings to the farmer and
yields 100 shillings in rent to the proprietor. But the proprietor
thinks that he would gain 110 shillings if he left it fallow or let it as
unprofitable pasture. “His gardener or vinedresser is dismissed,
but he gains 10 shillings and the nation loses 890. By and by the
capital employed in producing this plentiful supply will no longer
be so employed, and there will be no profit. The workers whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
former toil produced these products will no longer be employed
and no wages will be paid.”<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Examples are plentiful enough. A
number of the great Scotch proprietors, in order to replace the
ancient system of cultivation by the open pasture system, sent the
tenants from their dwellings and drove them into the towns or
huddled them on board ships for America. In Italy a handful of
speculators called the <i>Mercanti di tenute</i>, animated by similar motives,
have hindered the repopulation and cultivation of the Roman
Campagna, “that territory formerly so very fertile that five acres
were sufficient to provide sustenance for a whole family as well as
sending a recruit to the army. To-day its scattered homesteads, its
villages, the whole population, together with the farm enclosures,
the vineyards, and the olive plantations—products that require the
continual loving attention of mankind—have all disappeared, giving
place to a few flocks of sheep tended by a few miserable shepherds.”<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
The criticism is just, but is directed rather against the abuse of
private property than against the principle of the net product, for
this principle is incident to peasant proprietorship as well. It is
inevitable wherever production for a market takes place.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>It is just this opposition between proprietorship and labour that
supplies an explanation of economic crises.</p>

<p>Sismondi holds the view that crises are partly due to the difficulty
of acquiring exact knowledge of a market that has become very
extensive, and partly to the fact that producers are guided in their
actions by the amount of their capital rather than by the demand of
the market.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> But above all he thinks that they are due to the unequal
distribution of revenues. The consequence of the separation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
property from labour is that the revenues of those who possess lands
increase while the incomes of the workers always remain strictly at
the minimum. The natural result is a want of harmony in the
demand for products. With property uniformly divided and with an
almost general increase in the revenue there would result a certain
degree of uniformity in the growth of demand. Those industries
which supply our most essential and most general wants would
experience a regular and not an erratic expansion. But as a matter
of fact at the present time it is the revenue of the wealthy alone that
increases. Hence there is a growing demand for the more refined
objects in place of a regular demand for the ordinary things of life;
a neglect of the more fundamental industries, and a demand for the
production of luxuries. If the latter do not multiply quickly
enough, then the foreigner will be called in to satisfy the demand.
What is the result of these incessant changes? The old, neglected
industries are obliged to dismiss their workmen, while the new
industries can only develop slowly. During the interval the workmen
who have suffered dismissal are forced to reduce their consumption
of ordinary goods, and permanent under-consumption,
attended by a crisis, immediately follows. “Owing to the concentration
of wealth in the hands of a few proprietors, the home market
is contracted and industry must seek other outlets for its products
in foreign markets, where even more considerable revolutions are
possible.”<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Thus “the consumption of a millionaire master who
employs 1000 men all earning but the bare necessities of life is of
less value to the nation than a hundred men each of whom is much
less rich but who employ each ten men who are much less poor.”<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi’s explanation of crises, though adopted by many
writers since then, is not one of the best. The difficulty of adaptation
would in all probability not disappear even if wealth were to be
more equally distributed. Moreover, what he attempts to explain is an
evil that is chronic in certain industries and not the acute periodical
crises. But the theory has the merit of attempting to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
what still remains obscure, and what J. B. Say and Ricardo preferred
to pass over in silence or regarded as of secondary importance
under pretext that in the long run equilibrium would always be
re-established.</p>

<h4 id="heading22">IV: SISMONDI’S REFORM PROJECTS. HIS INFLUENCE
UPON THE HISTORY OF DOCTRINES</h4>

<p>The principal interest of Sismondi’s book does not lie in his
attempt to give a scientific explanation of the facts that occupied
his attention. Indeed, these attempts have little that is altogether
satisfactory, for the analysis is frequently superficial, and even
commonplace. His merit rather lies in having placed in strong relief
certain facts that were consistently neglected by the dominant school
of economists. Taken as a whole, his doctrine must be regarded as
pessimistic. He deliberately shows us the reverse of the medal, of
which others, even those whom we have classed as Pessimists—Ricardo
and Malthus—wished only to see the brighter side. It is no
longer possible to speak of the spontaneous harmony of interests, or
to forget the misery and suffering which lies beneath an appearance
of economic progress. Crises cannot be slipped over and treated as
transient phenomena of no great moment. No longer is it possible
to forget the important effects of an unequal division of property and
revenues, which frequently results in putting the contracting parties
in a position of fundamental inequality that annuls freedom of
bargaining. In a word, it is no longer possible to forget the social
consequences of economic transformations. And herein lies the
sphere of social politics, of which we are now going to speak.</p>

<p>The new point of view occupied by Sismondi enables him to
see that the free play of private interests often involves injury to
the general interest, and that the <i>laissez-faire</i> doctrine preached
by the school of Adam Smith has no longer any <i>raison d’être</i>.
On the contrary, there is room for the intervention of society,
which should set a limit to individual action and correct its abuses.
Sismondi thus becomes the first of the interventionists.</p>

<p>State action, in the first place, ought to be employed in curbing
production and in putting a drag upon the too rapid multiplication
of inventions. Sismondi dreams of progress accomplished by easy
stages, injuring no one, limiting no income, and not even lowering the
rate of interest.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> His sensitiveness made him timid, and critics smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
at his philanthropy. Even the Saint-Simonians, too sympathetic
to certain of his views, reproach him with having allowed himself
to be misled by it.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> This state of mind was reflected by his habits
in private life. Sainte-Beuve<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> relates of him how he used to employ
an old locksmith who had become so useless and awkward that everybody
had left him. Sismondi remained faithful to the old man even
to the very end, despite his inefficiency, lest he should lose his last
customer. He wished society to treat the older industries in a
similar fashion. He has been compared to Gandalin, the sorcerer’s
apprentice in the fable, who, having unlocked the water-gate with the
magic of his words, sees wave succeed wave, and the house inundated,
without ever being able to find the word which could arrest its flow.</p>

<p>Governments ought to temper their “blind zeal” instead of
urging on production.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Addressing himself to the savants, he begs
them to desist from invention and recall the sayings of the economists,
<i>laissez-faire</i>, <i>laissez-passer</i>, by giving to the generations which
their inventions render superfluous at least time to pass away. For
the old <i>régime</i>, with its corporations and wardens, he had the sincerest
regard, while condemning them as being harmful to the best interests
of production. Still he wondered whether some lesson could not
be gleaned from them which might help us in fixing limits to the
abuses of competition.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi never seems to have realised that any restriction placed
upon production with a view to alleviate suffering might hinder the
progress and well-being of the very classes that interested him most.
The conviction that the production of Europe was enough to satisfy
all demands supported these erroneous views.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Sismondi never
suspected the relative poverty of industrial society, a fact that
struck J. B. Say very forcibly. Moreover, he felt that on this point
the policy of Governments was not so easily modified, a feeling that
undermined his previous confidence.</p>

<p>Since the causes of the evils at present existing in society are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
(1) the absence of property, (2) the uncertainty of the earnings of
the working classes, all Government action ought to be concentrated
on these points.</p>

<p>The first object to be aimed at, wherever possible, was the union
of labour and property, and Sismondi eulogises the movement
towards a new patriarchal state—that is, towards a revival of
peasant proprietorship. The <i>Nouveaux Principes</i> contains a celebrated
description of the idyllic happiness of such a state. In
industry he wished for a return of the independent artisan. “I am
anxious that the industries of the town as well as country pursuits
should be carried on by a great number of independent workers instead
of being controlled by a single chief who rules over hundreds
and even thousands of workers. I hope to see manufactures in the
hands of a great number of capitalists of average means, and not
under the thumb of one single individual who constitutes himself
master over millions. I long to see the chance—nay, even the
certainty—of being associated with the master extended to every
industrious workman, so that when he gets married he may feel that
he has a stake in the industry instead of dragging on through the
declining years of life, as he too often does, without any prospect
of advancement.”<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> This for an end.</p>

<p>But the means? On this point Sismondi shows extraordinary
timidity. Appeal to the legislator is not followed up by a plan of
campaign, and in moments of scepticism and despair he even doubts
whether reform is ever possible. He declares himself an opponent
of communism. He rejects the Utopias of Owen, of Thompson,
and of Fourier, although he recognises that their aim was his also.
He failed to perceive that his “breaking up” process was quite as
illusory as the communistic Utopias which he shunned. He rejected
Owen’s system because he saw the folly of attempting to substitute
the interest of a corporation for that of the individual. But he
never realised that it had nothing to do with a corporation, and it
is possible that were he alive at the present time he would be an
ardent champion of co-operation.</p>

<p>But until the union of property and labour is realised Sismondi
is content with a demand for a simpler reform, which might alleviate
the more pressing sufferings of the working classes. First of all he
appeals for the restoration, or rather the granting, of the right of
combination.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Then follows a limitation of child labour, the abolition
of Sunday toil, and a shortening of the hours of labour.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
also demanded the establishment of what he called a “professional
guarantee,” whereby the employer, whether agriculturist or capitalist,
would be obliged to maintain the workman at his own expense during
a period of illness or of lock-out or old age. This principle once
admitted, the employers would no longer have any interest in
reducing the wages of the workman indefinitely, or in introducing
machinery or in multiplying production unduly. Having become
responsible for the fate of the workers, they would then take some
account of the effect which invention might have on their well-being,
whereas to-day they simply regard them from the point of view of
their own profits.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> One might be tempted to regard this as an anticipation
of the great ideal which has to a certain extent been realised
by the social insurance Acts passed during the last thirty years. But
this is only partly so. Sismondi placed the charge of maintenance
upon the master and not upon society, and his criticism of methods
of relief, especially of the English Poor Law, was that they tended
to decrease wages and to encourage the indifference of masters by
teaching the workers to seek refuge at the hands of the State rather
than at the hands of the masters.</p>

<p>In short, his reform projects, like his criticism of the economists,
reveal a certain degree of hesitation, due, no doubt, to the perpetual
conflict between reason and sentiment. Too keen not to see the
benefits of the new industrial <i>régime</i>, and too sensitive not to be
moved by some of its more painful consequences, too conservative
and too wise to hope for a general overthrow of society, he is content
to remain an astonished but grieved spectator of the helplessness
of mankind in the face of this evil. He did not feel himself competent
to suggest a remedy. He himself has confessed to this in touching
terms:</p>

<p>“I grant that, having indicated what in my opinion is the principle
of justice in this matter, I do not feel myself equal to the task
of showing how it can be realised. The present method of distributing
the fruits of industry among those who have co-operated in its
production appears to me to be curious. But a state of society
absolutely different from that with which we are now acquainted
appears to be beyond the wit of man to devise.”<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p class="tb">It is a striking fact that most of the important movements in
the nineteenth century can be traced back to Sismondi’s writings.
He was the first critic whom the Classical school encountered in its
march, and he treats us to a full <i>résumé</i> of its many heresies. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
bitter struggle which ensued the heretics won the day, their nostrums
taking the place of the Classical doctrines in the public favour. But
it seems hardly possible that Sismondi’s work should have determined
the course of these newer tendencies. His immediate influence was
extremely limited. It scarcely told at all except upon the socialists.
His book was soon forgotten, and not until our own day was its
importance fully realised. It would be truer to say that in the
course of the nineteenth century there was a spontaneous revival of
interest in the ideas promulgated by Sismondi. None the less he
was the first writer to raise his voice against certain principles
which were rapidly crystallising into dogmas. He was the earliest
economist who dared resist the conclusions of the dominant school,
and to point to the existence of facts which refused to tally with
the large and simple generalisations of his predecessors. If not the
founder of the new schools that were about to appear, he was their
precursor. They are inspired by the same feelings and welcome
the same ideas. His method is an anticipation of that of the Historical
school. His definition of political economy as a philosophy
of history<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> works wonders in the hands of Roscher, Knies, and
Hildebrand. His plea for a closer observation of facts, his criticism
of the deductive process and its hasty generalisations, will find an
echo in the writings of Le Play in France, of Schmoller in Germany,
and of Cliffe Leslie and Toynbee in England. The founders of the
German Historical school, in their ignorance of foreign writers,
regarded him as a socialist,<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> but the younger representatives of
that school have done full justice to his memory, and recognise him
as one of their earliest representatives.</p>

<p>By his appeal to sentiment and his sympathy for the working
classes, by his criticism of the industrial <i>régime</i> of machines and
competition, by his refusal to recognise personal interest as the only
economic motive, he foreshadows the violent reaction of humanitarianism
against the stern implacability of economic orthodoxy.
We can almost hear the eloquence of Ruskin and Carlyle, and the
pleading of the Christian Socialists, who in the name of Christian
charity and human solidarity protest against the social consequences
of production on a large scale. Like Sismondi, social Christianity
will direct its attack, not against the science itself, but against the
easy <i>bourgeois</i> complacency of its advocates. A charge of selfishness
will be brought, not against economic science as such, but against its
representatives and the particular form of society which it upholds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, by his plea for State intervention Sismondi inaugurated
a reaction against Liberal absolutism, a reaction that deepened in
intensity and covered a wider area as the century wore on, and
which found its final expression in State socialism, or “the socialism
of the chair.” He was the first to advocate the adoption of factory
legislation in France and to seek to give the Government a place in
directing economic affairs. The impossibility of complete abdication
on the part of the State would, he thought, become clearer every
day. But it was little more than an aspiration with him; it never
reached the stage of a practical suggestion.</p>

<p>Thus in three different ways Sismondi’s proposals were destined
to give rise to three powerful currents of thought, and it is not surprising
that interest in his work should have grown with the development
of the new tendencies which he had anticipated.</p>

<p>His immediate influence upon contemporary economists was very
slight. Some of them allowed themselves to be influenced by his
warmheartedness, his tenderness for the weak, and his pity for the
workers, but they never found this a sufficient reason for breaking off
their connections with the Classical school. Blanqui<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> in particular
was a convert to the extent that he admitted some exceptions to the
principle of <i>laissez-faire</i>. Theodore Fix and Droz<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> seemed won over
for a moment, and Sismondi might rightly have expected that the
<i>Revue mensuelle d’Économie politique</i>, started by Fix in 1833, would
uphold his views. But the days of the <i>Revue</i> were exceedingly few,
and before finally disappearing it had become fully orthodox. Only
one author, Buret, in his work on the sufferings of the working classes
in England and France,<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> has the courage to declare himself a whole-hearted
disciple of Sismondi. The name of Villeneuve-Bargemont,
author of <i>Économie politique chrétienne</i>, must be added to these.
His work, which was published in three volumes in 1834, bears
frequent traces of Sismondi’s influence.</p>

<p>Sismondi, though not himself a socialist, has been much read and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
carefully studied by socialists. It is among them that his influence is
most marked. This is not very surprising, for all the critical portion
of his work is really a vigorous appeal against competition and the
inequalities of fortune. Louis Blanc read him and borrowed from
him more than one argument against competition. The two German
socialists Rodbertus and Marx are still more deeply indebted to him.
Rodbertus borrowed from him his theory of crises, and owes him the
suggestion that social progress benefits only the wealthier classes.
Rodbertus quotes him without any mention of his name, but Marx
in his <i>Manifesto</i> has rendered him full justice, pointing out all
that he owed to his penetrative analysis. The most fertile idea
borrowed by Marx was that which deals with the concentration of
wealth in the hands of a few powerful capitalists, which results in
the increasing dependence of the working classes. This conception
is the pivot of the <i>Manifesto</i>, and forms a part of the very
foundation of Marxian collectivism. The other idea of exploitation
does not seem to have been borrowed from Sismondi, although he
might have discovered a trace of the surplus value theory in his
writings. Marx endeavours to explain profit by drawing a distinction
between a worker selling his labour and parting with some of his
labour force. Sismondi employs terms that are almost identical,
and says that the worker when selling his labour force is giving his
life. Elsewhere he speaks of a demand for “labour force.” Sismondi
never drew any precise conclusion from these ideas, but they
may have suggested to Marx the thesis he took such pains to
establish.</p>

<p>Many a present-day socialist, without acknowledging the fact,
perhaps without knowing it, loves to repeat the arguments which
Sismondi was the first to employ, to stir up his indifferent contemporaries.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II_SAINT-SIMON_THE_SAINT-SIMONIANS">CHAPTER II: SAINT-SIMON, THE SAINT-SIMONIANS,
AND THE BEGINNINGS OF
COLLECTIVISM</h3>

<p>Sismondi, by supplementing the study of political economy by
a study of social economics, had already much enlarged the area
traced for the science by its founders. But while giving distribution
the position of honour in his discussion, he never dared carry
his criticism as far as an examination of that fundamental institution
of modern society—private property. Property, at least, he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
legitimate and necessary. Every English and French economist
had always treated it as a thing apart—a fact so indisputable and
inevitable that it formed the very basis of all their speculations.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, we come upon a number of writers who, while
definitely rejecting all complicity with the earlier communists and
admitting neither equality of needs nor of faculties, but tending to
an agreement with the economists in claiming the maximum of
production as the one aim of economic organisation, dare lay their
hands upon the sacred ark and attack the institution of property
with whole-hearted vigour. Venturing upon what had hitherto been
holy ground, they displayed so much skill and courage that every
idea and every formula which became a commonplace of the socialistic
literature of the later nineteenth century already finds a place in
their system. Having definite ideas as to the end which they had in
view, they challenged the institution of private property because
of its effects upon the distribution and production of wealth. They
cast doubt upon the theories concerning its historical evolution, and
concluded that its abolition would help the perfection of the scientific
and industrial organisation of modern society. The problem of
private property was at last faced, and a recurrence of the discussion
was henceforth to become a feature of economic science.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Not that it had hitherto been neglected. Utopian communists
from Plato and More up to Mably, Morelly, Godwin, and Babeuf, the
eighteenth-century equalitarians, all rest their case upon a criticism
of property. But hitherto the question had been treated from the
point of view of ethics rather than of economics.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> The originality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of the Saint-Simonian treatment is that it is the direct outcome
of the economic and political revolution which shook France and
the whole of Europe towards the end of the eighteenth and the
beginning of the nineteenth centuries. The socialism of Saint-Simon
is not a vague aspiration for some pristine equality which was largely
a creation of the imagination. It is rather the naïve expression of
juvenile enthusiasm in the presence of the new industrial <i>régime</i>
begotten of mechanical invention and scientific discovery. The
modern spirit at its best is what it would fain reveal. It sought to
interpret the generous aspirations of the new <i>bourgeois</i> class, freed
through the instrumentality of the Revolution from the tutelage
of baron and priest, and to show how the reactionary policy of the
Restoration threatened its triumph. Not content, however, with
confining itself to the intellectual orbit of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, it sought
also to define the sphere of the workers in future society and to lay
down regulations for their benefit. But its appeal was chiefly to
the more cultured classes—engineers, bankers, artists, and savants.
It was to these men—all of them members of the better classes—that
the Saint-Simonians preached collectivism and the suppression
of inheritance as the easiest way of founding a new society upon
the basis of science and industry. Hence the great stir which the
new ideas caused.</p>

<p>Consequently Saint-Simonism appears to be a somewhat unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
extension of economic Liberalism rather than a tardy renewal of
ancient socialistic conceptions.</p>

<p>We must, in fact, distinguish between two currents in Saint-Simonism.
The one represents the doctrine preached by Saint-Simon
himself, the other is that of his disciples, the Saint-Simonians.
Saint-Simon’s creed can best be described as “industrialism” plus
a slight admixture of socialism, and it thus naturally links itself
with economic Liberalism, of which it is simply an exaggerated
development. The disciples’ doctrine, on the other hand, can only
be described as collectivism. But it is a collectivism logically
deduced from two of the master’s principles which have been extended
and amplified. For a history of economic ideas it is the theories
of the disciples that matter most, perhaps. But it would be impossible
to understand these without knowing something of Saint-Simon’s
theory. We shall give an explanation of his doctrine, first
attempting to show the links which surely, though strangely enough,
affiliate the socialism of Saint-Simon with economic Liberalism.</p>

<h4 id="heading23">I: SAINT-SIMON AND INDUSTRIALISM</h4>

<p>Saint-Simon was a nobleman who led a somewhat dissolute,
adventurous life. At the early age of sixteen he took part in the
American War of Independence. The Revolution witnessed the
abandonment of his claim to nobility, but by successful speculation
in national property he was enabled to retrieve his fortune to some
extent. Imprisoned as a suspect at Sainte-Pélagie, set free on
the 9th Thermidor, he attained a certain notoriety as a man of
affairs interested chiefly in travels and amusements and as a dilettante
student of the sciences. From the moment of his release
he began to regard himself as a kind of Messiah.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> He was profoundly
impressed by what seemed to him to be the birth of a new society
at which he had himself assisted, in which the moral and political and
even physical conditions of life were suddenly torn up by the roots,
when ancient beliefs disappeared and nothing seemed ready to take
their place. He himself was to be the evangelist of the new gospel,
and with this object in view on the 4th Messidor, An. VI, he called
together the capitalists who were already associated with him and,
pointing out the great necessity for restoring public confidence,
proposed the establishment of a gigantic bank whose funds might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
be employed in setting up works of public utility—a proof of the
curious way in which economic and philosophic considerations were
already linked together in his thoughts.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> An ill-considered marriage
which was hastily broken off, however, was followed by a period of
much extravagance and great misery. By the year 1805 so reduced
were his circumstances that he was glad to avail himself of the
generosity of one of his old servants. After her death he lived partly
upon the modest pension provided him by his family and partly upon
the contributions of a few tradesmen, but he was again so miserable
that in 1823 he attempted suicide. A banker of the name of Olinde
Rodrigues came to the rescue this time and supplied him with the
necessary means of support. He died in 1825, surrounded by a
number of his disciples who had watched over the last moments of
his earthly life. During all these years, haunted as he was by the
need for giving to the new century the doctrine it so much required,
he was constantly engaged in publishing brochures, new works, or
selections from his earlier publications, sometimes alone and sometimes
in collaboration with others,<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> in which the same suggestions
are always revived and the same ideas keep recurring, but in slightly
different forms.</p>

<p>Saint-Simon’s earlier work was an attempt to establish a scientific
synthesis which might furnish mankind with a system of positive
morality to take the place of religious dogmas. It was to be a kind
of “scientific breviary” where all phenomena could be deduced
from one single idea, that of “universal gravitation.” He himself
has treated us to a full account of this system, which is as
deceptive as it is simple, and which shows us his serious limitations
as a philosopher whose ambition far outran his knowledge. Auguste
Comte, one of his disciples, attempted a similar task in his <i>Cours
de Philosophie positive</i> and in the <i>Politique positive</i>, so that Saint-Simon,
who is usually considered the father of socialism, finds himself
also the father of positivism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>From 1814 up to his death in 1825 he partly relinquished his
interest in philosophy and devoted himself almost exclusively to the
exposition of his social and political ideas, which are the only ones
that interest us here.</p>

<p>His economics might be summed up as an apotheosis of industry,
using the latter word in the widest sense, much as Smith had employed
the term as synonymous with labour of all kind.</p>

<p>His leading ideas, contained within the compass of a few striking
pages, have since become known as “Saint-Simon’s Parable.”</p>

<p>“Let us suppose,” says he, “that France suddenly loses fifty
of her first-class doctors, fifty first-class chemists, fifty first-class
physiologists, fifty first-class bankers, two hundred of her best
merchants, six hundred of her foremost agriculturists, five hundred
of her most capable ironmasters, etc. [enumerating the principal
industries]. Seeing that these men are its most indispensable
producers, makers of its most important products, the minute that
it loses these the nation will degenerate into a mere soulless body
and fall into a state of despicable weakness in the eyes of rival
nations, and will remain in this subordinate position so long as
the loss remains and their places are vacant. Let us take another
supposition. Imagine that France retains all her men of genius,
whether in the arts and sciences or in the crafts and industries,
but has the misfortune to lose on the same day the king’s brother,
the Duke of Angoulême, and all the other members of the royal
family; all the great officers of the Crown; all ministers of State,
whether at the head of a department or not; all the Privy Councillors;
all the masters of requests; all the marshals, cardinals,
archbishops, bishops, grand vicars and canons; all prefects and
sub-prefects; all Government employees; all the judges; and on
top of that a hundred thousand proprietors—the cream of her nobility.
Such an overwhelming catastrophe would certainly aggrieve the
French, for they are a kindly-disposed nation. But the loss of a
hundred and thirty thousand of the best-reputed individuals in the
State would give rise to sorrow of a purely sentimental kind. It
would not cause the community the least inconvenience.”<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>In other words, the official Government is a mere façade. Its
action is wholly superficial. Society might exist without it and
life would be none the less happy. But the disappearance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
savants, industrial leaders, bankers, and merchants would leave the
community crippled. The very sources of wealth would dry up,
for their activities are really fruitful and necessary. They are the
true governors who wield real power. Such was the parable.</p>

<p>According to Saint-Simon, little observation is needed to realise
that the world we live in is based upon industry, and that anything
besides industry is scarcely worth the attention of thinking people.
A long process of historical evolution, which according to Saint-Simon
commenced in the twelfth century with the enfranchisement
of the communes and culminated in the French Revolution, had
prepared the way for it.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> At least industry is the one cardinal
feature of the present day.</p>

<p>The political concerns of his contemporaries were regarded with
some measure of despair. The majority of them were engaged either
in defending or attacking the Charter of 1814. The Liberals were
simply deceiving themselves, examining old and meaningless formulæ
such as “the sovereignty of the people,” “liberty,” and
“equality”—conceptions that never had any meaning,<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> but were
simply metaphysical creations of the jurists,<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and they ought to
have realised that this kind of work was perfectly useless now that
the feudal <i>régime</i> was overthrown. Men in future will have something
better to do than to defend the Charter against the “ultras.” The
parliamentary <i>régime</i> may be very necessary, but it is just a passing
phase between the feudalism of yesterday and the new order of
to-morrow.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> That future order is Industrialism—a social organisation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
having only one end in view, the further development of industry,
the source of all wealth and prosperity.</p>

<p>The new <i>régime</i> implies first of all the abolition of all class distinction.
There will be no need for either nobles, <i>bourgeois</i>, or
clergy. There will be only two categories, workers and idlers—or
the bees and the drones, as Saint-Simon puts it. Sometimes he
refers to them as the national and anti-national party. In the new
society the second class<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> is bound to disappear, for there is only
room for the first. This class includes, besides manual workers,<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
agriculturists, artisans, manufacturers, bankers, savants, and artists.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
Between these persons there ought to be no difference except that
which results from their different capacities, or what Saint-Simon
calls their varying stakes in the national interest. “Industrial
equality,” he writes, “consists in each drawing from society benefits
exactly proportionate to his share in the State—that is, in proportion
to his potential capacity and the use which he makes of the means
at his disposal—including, of course, his capital.”<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Saint-Simon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
evidently has no desire to rob the capitalists of their revenues; his
hostility is reserved for the landed proprietors.</p>

<p>Not only must every social distinction other than that founded
upon labour and ability disappear, but government in the ordinary
sense of the term will largely become unnecessary. “National
association” for Saint-Simon merely meant “industrial enterprise.”
“France was to be turned into a factory and the nation
organised on the model of a vast workshop”; but “the task of
preventing thefts and of checking other disorders in a factory is
a matter of quite secondary importance and can be discharged by
subordinates.”<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> In a similar fashion, the function of government
in industrial society must be limited to “defending workers from the
unproductive sluggard and maintaining security and freedom for
the producer.”<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>So far Saint-Simon’s “industrialism” is scarcely distinguishable
from the “Liberalism” of Smith and his followers, especially J. B.
Say’s. Charles Comte and Dunoyer, writing in their review, <i>Le
Censeur</i>, were advancing exactly similar doctrines,<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> sometimes even
using identical terms. “Plenty of scope for talent” and <i>laissez-faire</i>
were some of the favourite maxims of the Liberal <i>bourgeois</i>.
Such also were the aspirations of Saint-Simon.</p>

<p>But it is just here that the tone changes.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>Assuming that France has become a huge factory, the most
important task that awaits the nation is to inaugurate the new
manufacturing <i>régime</i> and to seek to combine the interests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<i>entrepreneurs</i> with those of the workers on the one hand and of the
consumers on the other. There is thus just enough room for government—of
a kind. What is required is the organising of forces rather
than the governing of men.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Politics need not disappear altogether,
but “must be transformed into a positive science of productive
organisation.”<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> “Under the old system the tendency was to
increase the power of government by establishing the ascendancy
of the higher classes over the lower. Under the new system the
aim must be to combine all the forces of society in such a fashion
as to secure the successful execution of all those works which tend
to improve the lot of its members either morally or physically.”<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>Such will be the task of the new government, where capacity
will replace power and direction will take the place of command.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
Applying itself to the execution of those tasks upon which there is
complete unanimity, most of them requiring some degree of deliberation
and yet promptness of action, it will gradually transform
the character of politics by concentrating attention upon matters
affecting life or well-being—the only things it need ever concern
itself with.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>In order to make his meaning clearer, Saint-Simon proposes to
confine the executive power to a Chamber of Deputies recruited from
the representatives of commerce, industry, manufacture, and agriculture.
These would be charged with the final acceptance or refusal
of the legislative proposals submitted to them by the other two
Chambers, composed exclusively of savants, artists, and engineers.
The sole concern of all legislation would, of course, be the development
of the country’s material wealth.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>An economic rather than a political form of government, administering
things instead of governing men, with a society modelled on
the workshop and a nation transformed into a productive association
having as its one object “the increase of positive utility by means of
peaceful industry”<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>—such are the ruling conceptions which distinguish
Saint-Simon from the Liberals and serve to bring him into
the ranks of the socialists. His central idea will be enthusiastically
welcomed by the Marxian collectivists, and Engels speaks of it as
the most important doctrine which its author ever propounded.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
Proudhon accepts it, and as a practical ideal proposes the absorption
of government and its total extinction in economic organisation.
The same idea occurs in Menger’s <i>Neue Staatslehre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> and in Sorel’s
writings, where he speaks of “reorganising society on the model of a
factory.”<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>It is this novel conception of government that most clearly
distinguishes Saint-Simon’s industrialism from economic Liberalism.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>But, despite the fact that he gave to socialism one of its most
fruitful conceptions, we hardly know whether to class Saint-Simon
as a socialist or not, especially if we consider that the essence of
socialism consists in the abolition of private property. It is true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that in one celebrated passage he speaks of the transformation of
private property.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> But it is quite an isolated exception. Capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
as well as labour, he thought, were entitled to remuneration. The
one as well as the other involved some social outlay. He would
probably have been quite content with a purely governmental
reform.</p>

<p>It would not be difficult, however, to take the ideal of industrialism
as outlined by Saint-Simon as the basis of a demand for a
much more radical reform and a much more violent attack upon
society. Such was the task which the Saint-Simonians took upon
themselves, and our task now is to show how collectivism was
gradually evolved out of industrialism.</p>

<h4 id="heading24">II: THE SAINT-SIMONIANS AND THEIR CRITICISM OF
PRIVATE PROPERTY</h4>

<p>Saint-Simon’s works were scarcely ever read. His influence was
essentially personal, and the task of spreading a knowledge of his
ideas devolved upon a number of talented disciples whom he had
succeeded in gathering round him. Augustin Thierry, who was his
secretary from 1814 to 1817, became his adopted son. Auguste
Comte, who occupied a similar post, was a collaborator in all his
publications between 1817 and 1824. Olinde Rodrigues and his
brother Eugène were both among his earliest disciples. Enfantin,
an old student of the Polytechnic, and Bazard, an old Carbonaro
who had grown weary of political experiments, were also of the
number. Soon after the death of Saint-Simon his following founded
a journal called <i>Le Producteur</i> with a view to popularising his ideas.
Most of the articles on economics were contributed by Enfantin.
The paper lasted only for one year, although the number of converts
to the new doctrine was rapidly increasing. All of them were
persuaded that Saint-Simon’s ideas furnished the basis of a really
modern faith which would at once supplant both decadent Catholicism
and political Liberalism, the latter of which, in their opinion,
was a purely negative doctrine.</p>

<p>In order to strengthen the intellectual ties which already united
them, this band of enthusiasts set up among themselves a sort of
hierarchy having at its summit a kind of college or institution
composed of the more representative members of the group, upon
whom the title “fathers” was bestowed. The next lower grade
was composed of “sons,” who were to regard one another as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
“brothers.” It was in 1828, under the influence of Eugène Rodrigues,
that the Saint-Simonians assumed this character of an organised sect.
About the same time Bazard, one of their number, was giving an
exposition of the creed in a series of popular lectures. These lectures,
delivered during the years 1828-30, and listened to by many men
who were afterwards to play an important part in the history of
France, such as Ferdinand de Lesseps, A. Carrel, H. Carnot, the
brothers Péreire, and Michel Chevalier, were published in two
volumes under the title <i>Exposition de la Doctrine de Saint-Simon</i>.
The second volume is more particularly concerned with philosophy
and ethics. The first includes the social doctrine of the school, and
according to Menger forms one of the most important expositions
of modern socialism.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, under the influence of Enfantin the philosophical
and mystical element gained the upper hand and led to the downfall
of the school.</p>

<p>The Saint-Simonians considered that it was not enough to take
modern humanity into its confidence and reveal to it its social
destiny. It must be taught to love and desire that destiny with
all the ardour of romantic youth. For the accomplishment of this
end there must exist a unity of action and thought such as a common
religious conviction alone can confer. And so Saint-Simonism
became a religion, a cult with a moral code of its own, with meetings
organised and churches founded in different parts of the country,
and with apostles ready to carry the good tidings to distant lands.
A striking phenomenon surely, and worthy the fullest study. It
was a genuine burst of religious enthusiasm among men opposed to
established religion but possessed of fine scientific culture—the
majority of whom, however, as it turned out, were better equipped
for business than for the propagation of a new gospel.</p>

<p>Enfantin and Bazard were to be the popes of this new Catholicism.
But Bazard soon retired and Enfantin became “supreme Father.”
He withdrew, with forty of the disciples, into a house at Ménilmontant,
where they lived a kind of conventual life from April to
December 1831. Meanwhile the other propagandists were as active
as ever, the work being now carried on in the columns of <i>Le Globe</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
which became the property of the school in July 1831. This strange
experiment was cut short by judicial proceedings, which resulted in
a year’s imprisonment for Enfantin, Duverger, and Michel Chevalier,
all of whom were found guilty of forming an illegal association. This
was the signal for dispersion.</p>

<p>The last phase was the most extravagant in the whole history
of the school, and naturally it was the phase that attracted most
attention. The simple social doctrine of Saint-Simon was overwhelmed
by the new religion of the Saint-Simonians, much as the
Positivist religion for a while succeeded in eclipsing the Positive
philosophy. Our concern, of course, is chiefly with the social
doctrine as expounded in the first volume of the <i>Exposition</i>.
That doctrine is sufficiently new to be regarded as an original
development and not merely as a <i>résumé</i> of Saint-Simon’s ideas.
Both Bazard and Enfantin had some hand in it. But it is almost
certain that it was the latter who supplied the economic ideas,<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
and that to the formation of those ideas Sismondi’s work contributed
not a little. The work is quite as remarkable for the vigorous logical
presentation of the doctrine as it is for the originality of its
ideas. The oblivion into which it has fallen is not easily explicable,
especially if we compare it with the many mediocre productions
that have somehow managed to survive. There are not wanting
signs of a revived interest in the doctrines, and for our own part
we are inclined to give them a very high place among the economic
writings of the century.</p>

<p>The <i>Doctrine de Saint-Simon</i> resolves itself into an elaborate
criticism of private property.</p>

<p>The criticism is directed from two points of view—that of distribution
and that of the production of wealth, that of justice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that of utility. The attack is carried on from both sides at once,
and most of the arguments used during the course of the century
are here hurled indiscriminately against the institution of private
property. The doctrines of Saint-Simon contributed not a little to
the success of the campaign.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Saint-Simon had already emphasised the impossibility of
workers and idlers coexisting in the new society. Industrialism
could hold out no promise for the second class. Ability and labour
only had any claim to remuneration. By some peculiar misconception,
however, Saint-Simon had regarded capital as involving
some degree of personal sacrifice which entitled it to special remuneration.
It was here that the Saint-Simonians intervened. Was it
not perfectly obvious that private property in capital was the worst
of all privileges? The Revolution had swept away caste distinctions
and suppressed the right of primogeniture, which tended to perpetuate
inequality among members of the same family, but had failed to
touch individual property and its privilege of “laying a toll upon
the industry of others.” This right of levying a tax is the fundamental
idea in all their definitions of private property.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Property,
according to the generally accepted meaning of the term to-day,
consists of wealth which is not destined to be immediately consumed,
but which entitles its owner to a revenue. Within this category are
included the two agents of production, land and capital. These are
primarily instruments of production, whatever else they may be.
Property-owners and capitalists—two classes that need not be
distinguished for our present purpose—have the control of these
instruments. Their function is to distribute them among the
workers. The distribution takes place through a series of operations
which give rise to the economic phenomena of interest and rent.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
Consequently the worker, because of this concentration of property
in the hands of a few individuals, is forced to share the fruits of his
labour. Such an obligation is nothing short of the exploitation of
one man by another,<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> an exploitation all the more odious because
the privileges are carefully preserved for one section of the community.
Thanks to the laws of inheritance, exploiter and exploited
never seem to change places.</p>

<p>To the retort that proprietors and capitalists are not necessarily
idle—that many of them, in fact, work hard in order to increase their
incomes—the Saint-Simonians reply that all this is beside the point.
A certain portion of the income may possibly result from personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
effort, but whatever they receive either as capitalists or proprietors
can obviously only come from the labour of others, and that clearly
is exploitation.</p>

<p>It is not the first time we have encountered this word “exploitation.”
We are reminded of the fact that Sismondi made use of it,<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
and the same term will again meet us in the writings of Marx and
others. None of them, however, uses it in quite the same sense, and
it might be useful to distinguish here between the various meanings
of a term which plays such an important <i>rôle</i> in socialist literature
and which leads to so much confusion.</p>

<p>Sismondi, we know, regarded interest as the legitimate income of
capital, but at the same time admitted that the worker may be
exploited.</p>

<p>Such exploitation, he thought, took place whenever the wages
were barely sufficient to keep the wage-earner alive, although
at the same time the master might be living in luxurious ease.
In other words, there is exploitation whenever the worker gets less
than a “just” wage. It is merely a temporary defect and not
an ineradicable disease of the economic system. It certainly does
occur occasionally, although there is no reason why it ever should,
and it may be removed without bringing the whole system to ruin.
Conceived of in this vague fashion, what is known as exploitation
is as difficult to define as the “just price” itself. It appears under
several aspects, and is by no means peculiar to the master-servant
relation. An individual is exploited whenever advantage is taken
of his ignorance or timidity, his weakness or isolation, to force
him to part with his goods or his services at less than the “just
price” or to pay more for the goods or services of others than they
are really worth.</p>

<p>The Saint-Simonians, on the other hand, considered that exploitation
was an organic defect of our social order. It is inherent in
private property, of which it is an invariable concomitant. It is not
simply an incidental abuse, but the most characteristic trait of the
whole system, for the fundamental attribute of all property is just
this right to enjoy the fruits of labour without having to undergo the
irksome task of producing. Such exploitation is not confined to
manual labourers; it applies to every one who has to pay a tribute to
the proprietor. The <i>entrepreneur</i>, in his turn, becomes a victim
because of the interest which he pays to the capitalist, who supplies
him with the funds which he needs.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>entrepreneur’s</i> profit, on the other hand, is not the result of
exploitation. It represents payment for the work of direction.
The master may doubtless abuse his position and reduce the wages
of the workers excessively. The Saint-Simonians would then agree
with Sismondi in calling this exploitation. But this is not a necessity
of the system. And the Saint-Simonians look forward to a future
state of society in which exceptional capacity will always be able
to enjoy exceptional reward.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> This is one of the most interesting
elements in their theory.</p>

<p>Marx conceives of exploitation as an organic vice inherent in
capitalism. But with him the term has quite a different connotation
from that given it by the Saint-Simonians. Following the lead of
certain English socialists, Marx comes to the conclusion that the
origin of exploitation must be sought in the present method of
exchanging wealth. Labour, in his opinion, is the source of all value,
and consequently interest and profit must be of the nature of theft.
The <i>entrepreneur’s</i> revenue is quite as unjust as the capitalist’s or
landlord’s.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>This last theory, with its wholesale condemnation of income of
every kind save the worker’s wage, seems much more logical than
any of the others. But as a matter of fact it is much more open to
criticism. If it can be demonstrated that the value of products is
not the mere result of manual labour, then Marx’s idea falls to
the ground. The Saint-Simonians were never embarrassed by
any theory of value. Their whole contention rests upon the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
between the income which is got from labour and the
revenue which is derived from capital, which every one can appreciate.
It was a distinction which had already been emphasised
by Sismondi, and no conclusion other than the illegitimacy of all
revenue not derived from labour can be drawn from the premises
thus stated. Some basis other than labour must be discovered if
this revenue is ever to be justified, and a new defence of private
property must somehow be attempted.</p>

<p>The exigencies of production itself may supply such justification.
Private property and the special kind of revenue which is derived
from its possession justifies itself, in the opinion of a growing number
of economists, on account of the stimulus it affords to production
and the accumulation of wealth. This seems the most advantageous
method of defence, and it is one of the grounds chosen by the
Physiocrats.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>But the Saint-Simonians from the very first set this argument
aside and attacked the institution of private property in the interests
of social utility no less than in the interest of justice. Production
as well as distribution, in their opinion, demanded its extinction.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This brings us to the second point, which Saint-Simon did
little more than suggest, namely, whether the institution of private
property as at present existing is in the best interests of producers.
The Saint-Simonians hold that it clearly is not, so long as the present
method of distributing the instruments of production continues. At
the present moment capital is transmitted in accordance with the
laws of inheritance. Individuals chosen by the accident of birth
are its depositors, and they are charged with the most difficult of all
tasks, namely, the best utilisation of the agents of production.
Social interest demands that they should be placed in more capable
hands and distributed in those places and among those industries
in which the need for those particular instruments is most keenly
felt, without any fear of a scarcity in one place or a glut in another.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
To-day it is a blind chance that picks out the men destined to carry
out this infinitely difficult task. And all the efforts of the Saint-Simonians
are concentrated just on this one point—inheritance.</p>

<p>Their indignation is easily explained. There is certainly something
paradoxical in the fact to which they draw attention. If we
accept Smith’s view, that government “is in reality instituted for
the defence of those who have some property against those who have
none at all”—a very narrow conception of the function of government<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>—inheritance
is simply inevitable. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
if we put ourselves at the point of view of the Saint-Simonians,
who lived in an industrial society where wealth was regarded, not
as an end, but as a means, not merely as the source of individual
income, but as the instrument of social production, it seems utterly
wrong that it should be left at the disposal of the first comer. The
practice of inheritance can only be justified on the ground that it
provides a stimulus to the further accumulation of wealth, or that
in default of a truly rational system the chances of birth are not
much more open to criticism than any other.</p>

<p>Such scepticism was little to the taste of the Saint-Simonians.
But they were firmly convinced that all the disorders of production,
whether apparent or real, were due to the dispersion of property
according to the chances of life and death.</p>

<p>“Each individual devotes all his attention to his own immediate
dependents. No general view of production is ever taken. There
is no discernment and no exercise of foresight. Capital is wanting
here and excessive there. This want of a broad view of the needs
of consumers and of the resources of production is the cause of those
industrial crises whose origin has given rise to so much fruitless
speculation and so many errors which are still circulating in our
midst. In this important branch of social activity, where so much
disturbance and such frequent disorder manifests itself, we see the
evil result of allowing the distribution of the instruments of production
to be in the hands of isolated individuals who are at once
ignorant of the demands of industry, of other men’s needs, and of
the means that would satisfy them. This and nothing else is the
cause of the evil.”<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>Escape from such economic anarchy, which has been so frequently
described, can only become possible through collectivism—at least
so the Saint-Simonians thought.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The State is to become the sole
inheritor of all forms of wealth. Once in possession of the instruments
of production, it can distribute them in the way it thinks
best for the general interest. Government is conceived on the
model of a great central bank where all the wealth of the country
will be deposited and again distributed through its numerous branches.
The uttermost ends of the kingdom will be made fertile, and the
necessaries of life will be supplied to all who dwell therein. The
best of the citizens will be put to work at tasks that will call forth
their utmost efforts, and their pay will be as their toil. This social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
institution would be invested with all the powers which are so blindly
wielded by individuals at the present moment.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>We need not insist too much on this project or press for further
details, which the Saint-Simonians would have some difficulty in
supplying.</p>

<p>Who, for example, is to undertake the formidable task of judging
of the capacity of the workmen or of paying for their work? They
are to be the “generals”—the superiors who are to be set free from
the trammels of specialisation and whose instinctive feelings will
naturally urge them to think only of the general interest. The
chief will be he who shows the greatest concern about the social
destiny of the community.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> It is not very reassuring, especially
when we remember that even with the greatest men there is occasionally
a regrettable confusion of general and private interests.</p>

<p>But admitting the incomparable superiority of the “generals,”
what of obeying them? Will the inferiors take kindly to submission
or will they have to be forced to it? The first alternative was the
one which they seemed to favour, for the new religion, “Saint-Simonism,”
would always be at hand to inspire devotion and to
deepen the respect of the inferiors for their betters.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> One is tempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to ask what would become of the heretics if ever there happened to
be any.</p>

<p>Further criticism of this kind can serve no useful purpose, and
it applies to every collective system, differing only in matters of
detail. Whenever it is proposed to set up an elaborate plan of
economic activity, directed and controlled by some central authority,
with a view to supplanting the present system of individual initiative
and social spontaneity, we are met at the threshold with the difficulty
of setting up a new code of morality. Instead of the human heart
with its many mixed motives, its insubordination and weaknesses,
in place of the human mind with all its failings, ignorance, and error,
is to be substituted a heart and mind altogether ideal, which only
serve to remind us how far removed they are from anything we have
ever known. The Saint-Simonians recognised that a change so
fundamental could only be accomplished through the instrumentality
of religion. In doing this they have shown an amount of foresight
which is rare among the critics who treat their ideas with such disdain.</p>

<p>It is more important that we should insist upon another fact,
namely, that the Saint-Simonian system is the prototype of all the
collectivist schemes that were proposed in the course of the century.</p>

<p>The whole scheme is very carefully thought out, and rests upon
that penetrative criticism of private property which differentiates
it from other social Utopias. The only equality which the Saint-Simonians
demanded was what we call equality of opportunity—an
equal chance and the same starting-point for every one. Beyond
that there is to be inequality in the interests of social production
itself. To each according to his capacity, and to every capacity
according to the work which it has accomplished—such is the rule
of the new society.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>An interesting <i>résumé</i> of the Saint-Simonians’ programme, given
in a series of striking formulæ which they addressed to the President
of the Chamber of Deputies,<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> is worth quoting:</p>

<p>“The Saint-Simonians do not advocate community of goods,
for such community would be a manifest violation of the first moral
law, which they have always been anxious to uphold, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
demands that in future every one shall occupy a situation becoming
his capacity and be paid according to his labour.</p>

<p>“In view of this law they demand the abolition of all privileges
of birth without a single exception, together with the complete
extinction of the right of inheritance, which is to-day the greatest
of all privileges and includes every other. The sole effect of this
system is to leave the distribution of social advantages to a chance
few who are able to lay some pretence to it, and to condemn the
numerically superior class to deprivation, ignorance, and misery.</p>

<p>“They ask that all the instruments of production, all lands and
capital, the funds now divided among individual proprietors, should
be pooled so as to form one central social fund, which shall be
employed by associations of persons hierarchically arranged so
that each one’s task shall be an expression of his capacity and his
wealth a measure of his labour.</p>

<p>“The Saint-Simonians are opposed to the institution of private
property simply because it inculcates habits of idleness and fosters
a practice of living upon the labour of others.”</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Critics of private property, generally speaking, are not content
with its condemnation merely from the point of view either of
distribution or production. They almost invariably employ a third
method of attack, which might be called the historical argument.
The argument generally takes the form of a demonstration of the
path which the gradual evolution of the institution of private property
has hitherto followed, coupled with an attempt to show that its
further transformation along the lines which they advocate is simply
the logical outcome of that process. The argument has not been
neglected by the Saint-Simonians.</p>

<p>The history of this kind of demonstration is exceedingly interesting,
and the <i>rôle</i> it has played in literature other than that of a
socialist complexion is of considerable importance. Reformers of
every type, whether the immediate objective be a transformation of
private property or not, always base their appeals upon a philosophy
of history.</p>

<p>Marx’s system is really a philosophy of history in which communism
is set forth as the necessary consummation of all industrial
evolution. Many modern socialists, although rejecting the Marxian
socialism, still appeal to history. M. Vandervelde builds his faith
upon it.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> The authors of that quite recent work <i>Socialisme en Action</i>
rely upon it, and so do Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb and all the Fabian
Socialists. Dupont-White’s State Socialism is inspired by similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
ideas, and so is the socialism of M. Wagner. Friedrich List has a
way of his own with history; and the earliest ambition of the Historical
school was to transform political economy into a kind of
philosophy of history. If we turn to the realm of philosophy itself
we find somewhat similar conceptions—the best known, perhaps,
being Comte’s theory of the three estates, which was borrowed directly
from Saint-Simon.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss historical parallels. The point
will come up in a later chapter in connection with the Historical
school. What we would remark here is the good use which the Saint-Simonians
made of the argument. All the past history of property
was patiently ransacked, and the arguments of other writers who have
extolled the merits of collectivism were thus effectually forestalled.</p>

<p>“The general opinion seems to be,” says the <i>Doctrine de Saint-Simon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
“that whatever revolutions may take place in society,
this institution of private property must for ever remain sacred and
inviolable; it alone is from eternity unto eternity. In reality
nothing could be less correct. Property is a social fact which, along
with other social facts, must submit to the laws of progress. Accordingly
it may be extended, curtailed, or regulated in various ways at
different times.” This principle, once it was formulated, has never
failed in winning the allegiance of every reformer. Forty years later
the Belgian economist Laveleye, who has probably made the most
thoroughly scientific study of the question, used almost identical
words in summing up his inquiry into the principal forms of property.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The Saint-Simonians feel confident that a glance at the progress
of this evolution is enough to convince anyone that it must have
followed the lines which they have indicated. The conception of
property was at first broad enough to include men within its connotation.
But the right of a master over his slaves gradually underwent
a transformation which restricted its exercise, and finally
caused its disappearance altogether. Reduced to the right of
owning things, this right of possession was at first transmissible
simply according to the proprietor’s will. But the legislature
intervened long ago, and the eldest son is now the sole inheritor.
The French Revolution enforced equal distribution of property
between all children, and so spread out the benefits which the
possession of the instruments of production confers. To-day the
downward trend of the rate of interest is slowly reducing the
advantages possessed by the owners of property, and goes a long
way towards securing to each worker a growing share of his
product.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> There remains one last step which the Saint-Simonians
advocate, which would secure to all workers an equal right to the
employment of the instruments of production. This reform would
consist in making everybody a proprietor, but the State the sole
inheritor. “The law of progress as we have outlined it would tend
to establish an order of things in which the State, and not the family,
would inherit all accumulated wealth and every other form of what
economists call the funds of production.”<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>These facts might be employed to support a conclusion of an
entirely different character. That equality of inheritance which
was preserved rather than created by the French Revolution might
be taken as a proof that modern societies are tending to multiply the
number of individual proprietors by dividing the land between an
increasing number of its citizens. But such discussion does not
belong to a work of this kind. We are entitled to say, however,
that the Saint-Simonian theory is a kind of prologue to all those
doctrines that ransack the pages of history for arguments in
favour of the transformation, or even the suppression, of private
property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again the Saint-Simonians have merely elaborated a view
which their master had only casually outlined. Saint-Simon, also
believed that in history we have an instrument of scientific precision
equal to the best that has yet been devised.</p>

<p>Saint-Simon, who owes something in this matter to Condorcet,
regarded mankind as a living being having its periods of infancy
and youth, of middle and old age, just like the individuals who
compose it. Epochs of intellectual ferment in the history of the
race are exactly paralleled by the dawning of intellectual interests
in the individual, and the one may be foretold as well as the other.
“The future,” says Saint-Simon, “is just the last term of a series
the first term of which lies somewhere in the past. When we have
carefully studied the first terms of the series it ought not to be
difficult to tell what follows. Careful observation of the past should
supply the clue to the future.”<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> It was while in pursuit of this
object that Saint-Simon stumbled across the term “industrialism”
as one that seemed to him to express the end towards which the
secular march of mankind appeared to lead. From family to city,
from city to nation, from nation to international federation—such
is the sequence which helps us to visualise the final term of the series,
which will be some kind of “a universal association in which all
men, whatever other relations they may possess, will be united.”<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
In a similar fashion the Saint-Simonians interpret the history of
individual property and predict its total abolition through a process
of its gradual extension to all individuals combined with the extinction
of private inheritance.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Saint-Simonians may well be regarded as a
kind of philosophy of history.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Contemplation of the system fills
them with an extraordinary confidence in the realisation of their
dreams, to which they look forward not merely with confidence, but
with feelings of absolute certainty. “Our predictions have the same
origins and are based upon the same kind of foundations as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
common to all scientific discoveries.”<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> They look upon themselves
as the conscious, voluntary agents of that inevitable evolution
which has been foretold and defined by Saint-Simon.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> This is one
trait which their system has in common with that of Marx. But
there are two important differences. The Marxians relied upon
revolution consummating what evolution had begun, while the
Saint-Simonians relied upon moral persuasion.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> The Saint-Simonians,
true children of the eighteenth century that they were,
believed that ideas and doctrines were sufficiently powerful agents
of social transformation, while the Marxians preferred to put their
hope in the material forces of production, ideas, in their opinion,
being nothing better than a pale reflection of such forces.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading25">III: THE IMPORTANCE OF SAINT-SIMONISM IN
THE HISTORY OF DOCTRINES</h4>

<p>The doctrine of the Saint-Simonians consists of a curious mixture of
realism and Utopianism. Their socialism, which makes its appeal
to the cultured classes rather than to the masses, is inspired, not
by a knowledge of working-class life, but by close observation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
remarkable intuition concerning the great economic currents of their
time.</p>

<p>The dispersion of the school gave the leaders an opportunity of
taking an active part in the economic administration of their own
country, and we find them throwing themselves whole-heartedly
into various schemes of a financial or industrial character. In 1863
the brothers Péreire founded a credit association which became the
prototype of the financial institutions of to-day. Enfantin took a
part in the founding of the P.L.M. Railway, which involved an
amalgamation of the Paris-Lyons, Lyons-Avignon, and Avignon-Marseilles
lines. Enfantin was also the first to float a company
for the purpose of making a canal across the isthmus of Suez. At
the Collège de France Michel Chevalier defended the action of the
State in undertaking certain works of a public character. It was he
also who negotiated the treaty of 1860 with England, which was the
means of inaugurating the era of commercial liberty for France.
Other examples might be cited to show the important part which the
Saint-Simonians played in nineteenth-century economic history.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>More especially did they realise the enormous place which banks
and institutions of a similar nature were bound to have in modern
industrial organisation. And whatever views we may hold as to the
rights of property, we are bound to recognise how these deposit banks
have already become great reservoirs of capital from which credit
is distributed in a thousand ways throughout the whole realm
of industry. Some writers, all of them by no means of the socialist
way of thinking, would reproach the banks, especially in France,
with their lack of courage in regulating and stimulating industry,
which, as the Saint-Simonians foresaw, is a legitimate part of their
duty.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The important part which they saw international financiers
playing in the domestic affairs of almost every European nation
during the Restoration period, coupled with their personal knowledge
of bankers, helped the Saint-Simonians in anticipating the all-important
<i>rôle</i> which credit was to play in modern industry.</p>

<p>Equally remarkable was the foresight they displayed in demanding
a more rigorous control of production, and in emphasising the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
need for some better method of adapting that production to meet
the exigencies of demand than is possible under a competitive
system. The State obviously has neither the ability nor the inclination
to discharge such functions, but so great are the inconveniences
of competition that manufacturers are forced to enter into agreements
with one another in order to exercise some such control.
This is nothing less than a partial application of the doctrine of
Saint-Simon.</p>

<p>In addition to the considerable personal influence which they
were able to exercise over economic development, we have to recognise
that in their writings we have the beginnings both of the critical
and of the constructive contribution made by socialists to nineteenth-century
economics. Their doctrine is, as it were, little
more than an index to later socialist literature.</p>

<p>In the first place one must be struck by the number of formulæ
to be met with in their work which have since become the commonplaces
of socialism. “The exploitation of man by man” was
a phrase that was exceedingly popular up to 1848. The term
“class war,” which has taken its place since the time of Marx,
expresses the same idea. They spoke of “the organisation of
labour” even before Louis Blanc, and employed the term “instrument
of labour” as a synonym for land and movable capital long
before it was so used by Marx. Although we have not considered it
necessary to group them with the Associationists, they have been as
assiduous as any in proclaiming the superior merits of producers’
associations. Moreover, they anticipated the use which the socialists
would make of the theory of rent. In a curious passage written
long before the time of Henry George they refer to the possibility of
applying the doctrines of Ricardo and Malthus to justify the devotion
of the surplus produce of good land to the general needs of society,
thus anticipating the theory of another prominent socialist thinker.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
Other ideas might be mentioned, though not of a specifically socialist
character. Thus the theory of profit-sharing, as far as our knowledge
goes, was first developed in an article in <i>Le Producteur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>The more one examines the doctrines of the Saint-Simonians
the more conscious does one become of the remarkable character
of these anticipations and of the injustice of the oblivion which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
since befallen them. Marx’s friend Engels called attention to the
“genial perspicacity of Saint-Simon, which enabled him to anticipate
all the doctrines of subsequent socialists other than those of a
specifically economic character.”<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The specifically economic idea of
which Engels speaks and which Saint-Simon, in his opinion, did
wrong to neglect was the Marxian theory of surplus value. We are
inclined to the opinion that it was more of a merit than a fault to
place socialism on its real foundation, which must necessarily be a
social one, rather than to found it upon an erroneous theory of
value.</p>

<p>But new formulæ are not their only contribution. Due note
was taken of that fundamental opposition which exists between
economists and socialists and which has caused all the conflicts and
misunderstandings that disfigure the history of the century and
resulted in their speaking an entirely different language. We shall
try to define the nature of the conflict, in order, if possible, to help
the reader over the difficulties that arise just where the bifurcation
of economic thought takes place.</p>

<p>No attempt was made either by Adam Smith, Ricardo, or J. B.
Say to make clear the distinction between the science of political
economy and the fact of social organisation.<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Property, as we have
already had occasion to remark, was a social fact that was accepted by
them without the slightest demur. The methods of dividing property
and of inheriting it, the causes that determined its rise and the consequences
that resulted from its existence, were questions that remained
outside the scope of their discussions. By division or distribution
of wealth they meant simply the distribution of the annual revenue
between the various factors of production. Their interest centres
round problems concerning the rate of interest or the rate of wages
or the amount of rent. Their theory of distribution is simply a
theory concerning the price of services. No attention was paid to
individuals, the social product being supposed to be divided between
impersonal factors—land, capital, and labour—according to certain
necessary laws. For convenience of discussion the impersonal occasionally
becomes personal, as when they speak of proprietors, capitalists,
and workers, but that is not allowed to affect the general trend
of the argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>For the Saint-Simonians, on the other hand, and for socialists
in general the problem of distribution consists especially in knowing
how property is distributed. The question is to determine why
some people have property while others have none; why the instruments
of production, land, and capital should be so unevenly distributed,
and why the revenues resulting from this distribution
should be unequal. For a consideration of the abstract factors
of production the socialists are anxious to substitute the study of
actual living individuals or social classes and the legal ties which
bind them together. These differing conceptions of distribution
have given rise to two different problems, the one primarily economic,
the other social, and sufficient care has not always been taken to
distinguish between these two currents, which have managed to
coexist, much to the confusion of social thinking in the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Another essential difference between their respective points of
view consists of the different manner in which economists and
socialists conceive of the opposition that exists between the general
interest and the interests of individuals.</p>

<p>Classical writers envisaged it as a conflict between the interests
of consumers, <i>i.e.</i> everybody, and the interests of producers, which
are more or less the interests of a particular class.</p>

<p>The Saint-Simonians, on the other hand—and in this matter
their distinction has met with the hearty approval of every socialist—think
it better to regard it as between workers on the one hand and
idlers on the other, or between workers and capitalists, to adopt the
cramped formula of a later period. The worker’s is the general
interest; the particular interest is that of the idler who lives at
the former’s expense. “We have on several occasions,” writes
Enfantin, “pointed out some of the errors in the classification
adopted by most present-day economists. The antithesis between
producer and consumer gives a very inadequate idea of the magnitude
of the gap that lies between the various members of society,
and a better differentiation would be that which would treat them
as workers and idlers.”<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The difference in the point of view naturally
results in an entirely different conception of social organisation.
Economists think that society ought to be organised from the point
of view of the consumer and that the general interest is fully
realised when the consumer is satisfied. Socialists, on the contrary,
believe that society should be organised from the standpoint of the
worker, and that the general interest is only fully achieved when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
workers draw their full share of the social product, which is as great
as it possibly can be.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>There is one last element of difference which is very important.
Classical writers made an attempt to reduce the apparent disorder
of individual action within the compass of a few scientific laws.
By the time the task was completed so struck were they with
the profound harmony which they thought they had discovered
that they renounced all attempts at amelioration. They were so
satisfied with the demonstration which they had given of the way
in which a spontaneous social force, such as competition, for example,
tended to limit individual egoism and to complete the triumph of
the general interest that they never thought of inquiring whether
the action of these forces might not be rendered a little less harmful
or whether the mechanism might not with advantage be lubricated
and made to run somewhat more smoothly.</p>

<p>The Saint-Simonians, on the other hand—and in this matter it
is necessary to couple with theirs the name of Sismondi—are convinced
of the slowness, the awkwardness, and the cruelty with which
spontaneous economic forces often go to work. Consequently they
are concerned with the possibility of substituting a more conscious,
carefully thought-out effort on the part of society. Instead of a
spontaneous reconciliation of conflicting interests they suggest an
artificial reconciliation, which they strive with all their might to
realise. Hence the innumerable attempts to set up a new mechanism
which might take the place of the spontaneous mechanism, and the
childish efforts to co-ordinate or combine economic forces. These
attempts, most of them of necessity unsuccessful, furnished the
adversaries of socialism with their best weapons of attack. All of
them, however, did not prove quite fruitless, and some of them were
destined to exercise a notable influence upon social development.</p>

<p>It is in the Saint-Simonian doctrine that we find these contrasts
between political economy and socialism definitely marked and in
full detail. It matters little to us to-day that the school was ridiculed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
or that the eccentricities of Enfantin destroyed his propaganda
work just when Fourier was pursuing his campaign with great
success. Ideas are the things that stand out in a history of doctrines.
To us, at any rate, Saint-Simonism appears as the first and most
eloquent as well as the most penetrating expression of the sentiments
and ideals that inspire nineteenth-century socialism.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III_THE_ASSOCIATIVE_SOCIALISTS">CHAPTER III: THE ASSOCIATIVE SOCIALISTS</h3>

<p>The name “Associative Socialists” is given to all those writers who
believe that voluntary association on the basis of some preconceived
plan is sufficient for the solution of all social questions. Unfortunately
the plans vary very considerably, according to the particular
system chosen.</p>

<p>They differ from the Saint-Simonians, who sought the solution
in socialisation rather than in association,<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> and thus became
the founders of collectivism, which is quite another thing. The
advocates of socialisation always thought of “Society” with a
capital S, and of all the members of the nation as included in one
collective organisation. The term “nationalisation” much better
describes what they sought. Associationism, on the other hand,
more individualistic in character and fearing lest the individual
should be merged in the mass, would have him safeguarded by
means of small autonomous groups, where federation would be
entirely voluntary, and any unity that might exist would be prompted
from within rather than imposed from without.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Associationists must be carefully distinguished
from the economists of the Liberal school. Fortunately this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
is not very difficult, for by means of these very associations they
claim to be able to create a new social <i>milieu</i>. They are as anxious
as the Liberals for the free exercise of individual initiative, but they
believe that under existing conditions, except in the case of a few
privileged individuals, this very initiative is being smothered. They
believe that liberty and individuality never can expand unless transplanted
into a new environment. But this new environment will
not come of itself. It must be created, just as the gardener must
build a conservatory if he is to secure a requisite environment.
Each one has his own particular recipe for this, and none of them is
above thinking that his own is the best.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> It is this conception of an
artificial society set up in the midst of present social conditions,
bound by strict limitations which to some extent isolate it from its
surroundings, that has won for the system its name of Utopian
Socialism.</p>

<p>Had the Associationists only declared that the social environment
can and ought to be modified, despite the so-called permanent and
immutable laws, just as man himself is capable of modification, they
would have enunciated an important truth and would have forestalled
all those who are to-day seeking a solution of the social question in
syndicalism, in co-operation, and in the garden-city ideal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, had they succeeded in carrying out their
plans on an extensive scale, if we may judge by the desire to evade
them on the part of those experimented on, it seems probable that
the new kind of liberty would have proved less welcome than the
liberty which is enjoyed under the present constitution of society.</p>

<p>They would have been very indignant, however, if anyone had
charged them with desiring to create an artificial society. On the
contrary, their claim was that the present social environment is
artificial, and that their business was not to create but merely to
discover that other environment which is already so wonderfully
adapted to the true needs of mankind in virtue of its providential,
natural harmony. At bottom it is the same idea as the “natural
order” of the Physiocrats, much as their conception differs from
that of the Physiocrats—an incidental proof that the order is
anything but “natural,” seeing that it varies with those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
define it. Some of their sayings, however, might very well have
been borrowed directly from Quesnay or Mercier de la Rivière—for
example, that of Owen’s in which he speaks of the commune as God’s
special agent for bringing society into harmony with nature. It is
just the “good despot” of the Physiocrats over again. Or take
Fourier’s comparison in which he ranks himself with Newton as the
discoverer of the law of “attraction of passion,” and believes that
his “stroke of genius,” as Zola calls it, lies in knowing how to utilise
the passions which God has given us to the best advantage.</p>

<p>What is still more interesting is that this newer socialism marks
a veritable reaction against the principles of 1789.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> The Revolutionists
hated every form of association, and suspected it of being a
mere survival of the old <i>régime</i>, a chain to bind the individual.
Not only was it omitted from the Declaration of the Rights of Man,<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
but it was formally prohibited in every province—prohibitions which
have been withdrawn only quite recently. It is difficult to imagine a
greater contrast to the spirit of the Revolution than the beliefs which
inspired Owen, Fourier, and Cabet, the founders of the new order.</p>

<p>But the men of 1789 were not so far wrong, nor were they deceived
by their recollections of corporations and guilds, when they expressed
the belief that any form of association was really a menace to liberty.
There is an old Italian proverb which states that every man who
has an associate has also a master. The Liberal school has to a
certain extent always shared these apprehensions, and ample justification
might be found for them in the many despotic acts of
associates, whether capitalists or workmen.</p>

<p>But the “associative” socialists of the early part of the last
century were impressed, even more than Sismondi and Saint-Simon
were, by the new phenomenon of competition. The mortal struggle
for profit among producers and the keen competition for wages
among working men which immediately ensued upon the disappearance
of the old framework of society seemed to them to wear
all the hideousness of an apocalyptic beast. With wonderful perspicacity
they predicted that such breakneck competition must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
inevitably result in combination and monopoly.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Voluntary association
of a co-operative character (they paid hardly any attention to
the possibilities of corporative association) appeared to supply the
only means of suppressing this competition without either endangering
liberty or thwarting the legitimate ambitions of producers. And
it is not very clear as yet that they were altogether mistaken in their
point of view.</p>

<p>The two best known representatives of this school are Robert
Owen and Charles Fourier. Although they were contemporaries—the
one was born in 1771, the other in 1772<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>—it does not appear that
they ever became known to one another. Owen never seems to
have paid any attention to Fourier’s system, and Fourier never refers
to “Owen’s communistic scheme” without showing some trace of
bitterness. Indeed, it is doubtful whether he knew anything at all
about it except from hearsay.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Such reciprocal ignorance does little credit to their powers of
observation. Still it is easily explained. Despite a certain similarity
in their plans for social regeneration—for example, they both
proceed to create small autonomous associations, the microcosms
which were to serve as models for the society of the future, or
the yeast which was to leaven the lump—and notwithstanding
that after their deaths they were both hailed as the parents of one
common offspring, co-operation, they spent their whole lives in
two very different worlds. Without any rhetorical exaggeration and
without making any invidious distinctions we may truthfully say
that Owen was a rich, successful manufacturer and one of the
greatest and most influential men of his day and country, while
Fourier was a mere employee in the realm of industry, or a “shop-sergeant,”
as he liked to call himself. Later on Fourier became the
recipient of a small annuity; but his reputation only spread slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and with much difficulty among a small circle of friends. Contrary
to what might have been expected, the millionaire manufacturer was
the more ardent socialist of the two. A militant communist and an
anti-cleric, he loved polemics, and advanced his views both in the
Press and on the platform. His humble rival was just a grown-up
boy with the habits of an old woman. He scarcely ever left his
house except to listen to a military band; he wrote sedulously,
attempting to turn out the same number of pages each day, and
spent most of his life on the look-out for a sleeping partner, who,
unfortunately, never turned up.</p>

<p>Other writers of whom we shall have something to say in connection
with this school are Louis Blanc, Leroux, and Cabet.</p>

<h4 id="heading26">I: ROBERT OWEN</h4>

<p>Robert Owen of all socialists has the most strikingly original, not
to say unique, personality. One of the greatest captains of industry
of his time, where else have we such a commanding figure? Nor
is his socialism simply the philanthropy of the kind-hearted
employer. It is true that it is not revolutionary, and that he
could not bring himself to support the Chartist movement, which
seems harmless enough now.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> He never suggested expropriation
as an ideal for working men, but he exhorted them to create new
capital, and it is just here that the co-operative programme differs
from the collectivist even to this day. But for all practical purposes
Owen was a socialist, even a communist. Indeed, he was probably
the first to inscribe the word “socialism” on his banner.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>His passion for Utopias did not prevent him initiating a number
of reforms and establishing several institutions of a thoroughly
practical character. Special mention ought to be made of his
interest in the welfare of his workers, an inspiration that has been
caught by several manufacturers since.</p>

<p>Nor must we imagine, simply because we have placed him along
with the Associative socialists, that association was the only solution
that met with his approval. As a matter of fact there is scarcely
a solution of any description which was not to some extent tried
by him.</p>

<p>Beginning with the establishment of model workshops in his
factory at New Lanark, there is hardly a suggestion incorporated
in his exposition of socialism which was not attempted and even
successfully applied in the course of his experiments there. Among
them are included such important developments as workmen’s
dwellings, refectories, the appointment of officials to look after the
social and moral welfare of the workers, etc.</p>

<p>These experiments had the further distinction of serving as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
model for the factory legislation of the next fifty years. We have
only to glance at the following programme of reforms effected by
him to realise this:</p>

<p>1. He reduced the hours of labour from seventeen to ten <i>per diem</i>.</p>

<p>2. No children under ten years of age were employed, but free
education was supplied them in schools built for the purpose.</p>

<p>3. All fines—then a common feature of all workshops—were
abolished.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>Seeing that neither his experiments nor his prestige as an employer
was sufficient to influence his fellow employers, he now tried to gain
the sympathetic attention of the legislature. He turned first of all
to the British Government, and then to that of other countries,
looking to legislation to provide what he believed should have been
supplied by the goodwill of the ruling classes themselves.</p>

<p>Even before the days of Lord Shaftesbury he had inaugurated a
campaign in favour of limiting the hours of children working in
factories. In 1819 the first Factory Act was passed, fixing the
minimum age at which children might be employed at nine years,
although Owen himself would have put it at ten.</p>

<p>Discouraged by the little support which he obtained for his
projects, and having satisfied himself as to the impotence both of
patronage and legislation as forces of social progress, he turned his
attention to a third possibility, namely, association. Association,
he imagined, would create that new environment without which
no solution of the social question was ever possible.</p>

<h5 id="heading27">1. <span class="smcap">The Creation of the <i>Milieu</i></span></h5>

<p>The creation of a social <i>milieu</i> was the one impelling force that
inspired all Owen’s various experiments. This was his one desire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
whether he asked it of the masters, the State, or of the workers
themselves.</p>

<p>He has thus some claim to be regarded as the father of etiology—etiology
being the title given by sociologists to that part of their
subject which treats of the subordination and adaptation of man to
his environment. His theory concerning the possibility of transforming
the organism by influencing its surroundings occupies the
same position in economics as Lamarck’s theory does in biology. By
nature man is neither good nor bad. He is just what his environment
has made him, and if at the present moment he is on the whole
rather bad, it is simply because his environment is so detestable.
Scarcely any stress is laid upon the natural environment which
seemed of such supreme importance to writers like Le Play. Owen’s
interest was in the social environment, the product of education and
legislation or of deliberate individual action.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Change the environment
and the individual would be changed. He failed to see that
this meant begging the whole question. If man is simply the
product of his environment, how can he possibly change that environment?
It is like asking a man to raise himself by the hair of his
head. But the futility of such criticism will be readily appreciated
if we remind ourselves that it is to such insignificant beginnings
as these that we owe the conception of the garden city. It was
Owen’s concern for the worker and his great desire to provide
him with a home where some degree of comfort and some measure
of beauty might be obtainable that gave the earliest impetus to
that movement.</p>

<p>From a moral point of view this deterministic conception
resulted in the absolute denial of all individual responsibility.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
Every noble or ignoble deed, every act, whether deserving of praise
or blame, of reward or punishment, reflects neither credit nor discredit
upon its author, for the individual can never be other than he
actually is.</p>

<p>There was all the more reason, then, why all religious influences,
especially that of Christianity, should be excluded. This contempt
for religion explains why Owen found so little support in English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
society, which revolted against what appeared like cynical atheism,
although Owen himself was really a deist.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>Economically, the doctrine of payment according to work rather
than capacity was to result in absolute equality. For why should
higher intelligence, greater vigour or capacity for taking pains
entitle a man to a greater reward if it is all a question of environment?
Hence Owen’s associations were to be communal.</p>

<p>We need not here detail the history of his experiments in colonisation.
It is the usual story of failure and disappointed hopes. At
last Owen himself was driven to the conclusion that his attempt
to mould the environment which was to recreate society had proved
unsuccessful. He renounced all his ambitions for building up a new
social order, and contented himself with an attempt to rid society as
at present constituted of some of the more potent evils that were
sapping its strength. And this brings us to his second essential idea,
the abolition of profit.</p>

<h5 id="heading28">2. <span class="smcap">The Abolition of Profit</span></h5>

<p>The first necessity, if the environment was ever to be changed,
was to get rid of profit. There was <i>the</i> essential evil, the original sin.
Profit was the forbidden fruit which had compassed the downfall of
man and caused his expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Its very
definition conveyed an implication of injustice, for it was always
defined as whatever was over and above cost of production. Products
ought to be sold for what they cost; the net price is the only just
price. But profit is not merely an injustice, it is a perpetual menace.
Economic crises resulting from over-production, or rather from under-consumption,<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
may always be traced back to an unhealthy desire
for profit. The existence of profit makes it impossible for the worker
to repurchase the product of his toil, and consequently to consume
the equivalent of what he produced. Immediately it is completed
the product is snatched up by a superior body which makes it
inaccessible either to the maker or to the men who could furnish an
equivalent amount of labour or who could offer as the price of
acquiring it a value equal to that labour.</p>

<p>The problem is to abolish this parasitism, and the first question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
that suggests itself is whether the ordinary operation of competition,
assuming it were altogether free and perfect, would be sufficient to
get rid of it. The economists declare that it would, and the
Hedonistic school makes bold to affirm that under a <i>régime</i> of perfect
competition the rate of profit would fall to zero. But Owen believed
nothing of the kind.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> He regarded competition and profit as inseparable,
and if one was war the other was simply the spoils of
conflict.</p>

<p>Accordingly some form of combination must be devised which
will suppress profit, together with “all that gives rise to that inordinate
desire for buying in the cheapest market and selling in the
dearest.” But the instrument of profit is gold or money. Profits
are always realised in the form of money.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Gold is an intermediary
in every act of exchange, and its intervention goes a long way
towards explaining the anomaly of selling a commodity for more
than cost price. The objective, then, must be money, and it must be
replaced by labour notes, which will supply us with a measure of
value altogether superior to money. Seeing that labour is the cause
and substance of value, it is only natural that it should afford us the
best means of measuring value. It is quite obvious that ample
homage is paid to the Ricardian theory of value, but conclusions
both novel and unproved are drawn from it.</p>

<p>The producer who wishes to dispose of his produce will be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
labour notes in proportion to the number of hours which he has
worked. In the same way the consumer who wishes to buy that
product will be called upon to pay an equivalent number of labour
notes, and so profit will be eliminated.</p>

<p>The condemnation of money was not new, but what was original
was the discovery that labour notes could supply the place of money,
a discovery which Owen considered “more valuable than all the
mines of Mexico and Peru.” It has truly been a wonderful mine,
and has been freely exploited by almost every socialist. But it
hardly squares with Owen’s communistic ideal, which aimed at
giving to each according to his needs. The labour notes evidently
imply payment according to the capacity of each. Besides, what is
the use of any system of exchange that is not to be employed for
purposes of distribution?<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>It remained to be seen whether this elimination of money could
actually be realised in practice. An experiment to that effect was
tried in London with the establishment of the National Equitable
Labour Exchange. This was the most interesting experiment in
the whole movement, although Owen himself was not very proud of
his connection with it. It took the form of a co-operative society
with a central depot where each member of the society could deposit
the product of his labour and draw the price of it in labour notes,
the price depending upon the number of hours of work the product
had cost, which the member himself was allowed to state. These
products, or goods as they were now called, marked with a figure
which indicated the number of hours they had taken to produce,
were at the disposal of any member of the Exchange who wished to
buy them. All that a member had to do was to pay the ticketed
price in labour notes. And so every worker who had taken, say,
ten hours to make a pair of stockings was certain of being able to
buy any other article which had also cost ten hours’ labour. In this
fashion everyone got whatever his product had cost him, and every
trace of profit automatically disappeared. The profit-maker, whether
industrial or commercial or merely an intermediary, was effectively
removed, because producers and consumers were brought into direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
contact with one another, and so the problem was apparently
solved.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>The experiment, which had about the same measure of success
as the attempts to establish a communal colony in America, did not
last very long. The slightest acquaintance with the laws of value
would have convinced the reformer of the futility of his attempt.
But it marks an important departure in the history of economic
doctrines as being the first of a long line of experiments designed to
solve the same problem, but with very different methods. It is the same
idea that inspires Proudhon’s Bank and Solvay’s <i>Comptabilisme social</i>.</p>

<p>The particular mechanism wherewith the elimination of profit
was essayed is really of quite secondary importance. But the
essential idea which lay behind the whole attempt—namely, the
abolition of profit—is at least partly realised in that solid and useful
institution which is now found all over the world, and which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
bequeathed to us by this experiment of Owen’s—the co-operative
stores. Their first appearance dates from 1832, the year of the
Bank of Exchange experiment, but it was not until ten years later
that they assumed their present form as the outcome of the efforts
of the Rochdale Pioneers.</p>

<p>The co-operative retail societies have as their rule either to
make no profits or to restore any profit that may accrue to their
members in proportion to the amount of their purchases at the
stores. In reality there is no profit, but simply a cancelling of
insurance against risks which has been shared in by all the members.
The process of elimination is strictly in accordance with Owen’s
method of putting producer and consumer in direct contact with
one another with a view to getting rid of the middleman. But the
elimination of profit is accomplished without eliminating money.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
That close relation which Owen and a number of other socialists
believed to exist between money and profit is purely imaginary. We
know as a matter of fact that the highest profits are to be got under
the truck system, in the African equatorial trade, for example,
where guns are exchanged at five times their value for caoutchouc
reckoned at a third of its value, representing a profit of 1500 per
cent. The employment of money has brought such definiteness into
the method of valuation that the rate of profit per unit on a yard
of cloth, say, has become almost infinitesimal. Such exactness of
calculation would have been impossible under either the truck or
the labour note system.</p>

<p>The co-operative association, with its system of no profits, will
for ever remain as Owen’s most remarkable work, and his fame will
for ever be linked with the growth of that movement. But he was
hardly conscious of the important part which he was playing in the
inauguration of the new movement. It is seldom that we meet
with the word “co-operation” in his writings, although that is not
a matter of any great consequence, because the term at that time
had not the significance which it has to-day, being then simply
synonymous with communism. Not only was Owen unwilling to
assume any parental responsibility for the co-operative society, his
latest offspring, but he expressly refused to consider it as at all
representative of his system. Shops of that description seemed to
him little better than philanthropic institutions, quite unworthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
his great ideal.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Before passing judgment upon him it is only fair
to remember that since those early days the character of the co-operative
stores has been completely changed. He lived to see the
establishment of the Rochdale society, with its twenty-eight pioneers,
six of whom were ardent disciples of Owen himself, and two of
these, Charles Howarth and William Cooper, were the very soul of
that immortal association. But Owen was by this time seventy-three
years of age, and he scarcely realised that a child had been
born to him. This somewhat late arrival was to perpetuate his
name, and more than any of his other schemes was to save it from
oblivion.</p>

<p>Owen had founded no school, unless of course we consider that
the co-operators are deserving of the title. There were, however, a
few disciples who attempted to apply his theories. One of these was
William Thompson, whose writings, forgotten for many years, have
recently come in for a good deal of extravagant praise. His principal
work, <i>An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth</i>, was
published in 1824. As compared with Owen he reveals a greater
depth of thought and shows a more thorough acquaintance with
economic science, and he ought perhaps to be given premier place as
the founder of socialism. But, as we have pointed out in the
Preface, we cannot readjust the judgment of history, and we are
bound to accept the names which tradition has made sacred. And
if a person’s rank in history is to be measured by his influence rather
than his talent, then Thompson’s influence was <i>nil</i>, for at the time
his work seems to have passed almost unnoticed.</p>

<p>We will only remark that Thompson’s grasp of the idea that
labour does not enjoy all it produces is much firmer than Owen’s.
This meant opening the way for a discussion of surplus value and
unproductive labour, of which more anon. He agrees with Owen in
thinking that expropriation would not remedy the evil, and he also
would rather build up a new form of enterprise in which the worker
would be able to retain for himself all the produce of his labour.
This was precisely the co-operative ideal.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="heading29">II: CHARLES FOURIER</h4>

<p>Owen’s practical influence has been much greater than Fourier’s, for
most of the important socialistic movements of the last century can
easily be traced back to Owen. But Fourier’s intellectual work,
when taken as a whole, though more Utopian and less restrained
in character than Owen’s, has a considerably wider outlook, and
combines the keenest appreciation of the evils of civilisation with
an almost uncanny power of divining the future.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>To some writers Fourier is simply a madman, and it is difficult
not to acquiesce in the description when we recall the many extravagances
that disfigure his work, which even his most faithful disciples
can only explain by giving them some symbolic meaning of which
we may be certain Fourier would never have thought.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> The term
“bourgeois socialist” seems to us to describe him fairly accurately,
but its employment lays us open to the charge of using a term that
he himself would never have recognised. But what are we to make
of one who speaks of Owen’s communistic scheme as being so pitiable
as to be hardly worth refuting; who “shudders to think of the
Saint-Simonians and of all their monstrosities, especially their
declamations against property and hereditary rights<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>—and all this
in the nineteenth century”; who in his scheme of distribution
scarcely drew any distinction between labour, capital, and business
ability, five-twelfths of the product being given to labour, four-twelfths
to capital (which is probably more than it gets to-day), and
three-twelfths to management; who outbid the most brazen-faced
company promoter by offering a dividend of 30 to 36 per cent., or for
those who preferred it a fixed interest of 8 per cent.;<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> who held up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the right of inheritance as one of the chief attractions that would be
secured by the Phalanstère; and who finally declared that inequality
of wealth and “even poverty are of divine ordination, and consequently
must for ever remain, since everything that God has ordained
is just as it ought to be”?<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>To the men of his time, and to every one who has not read him,
which means practically everybody, Fourier appears as an ultra-socialist
or communist. That opinion is founded not so much
upon the extravagance of his view or the hyperbolical character of
his writing as upon the popular conception of the Phalanstère, which
was the name bestowed upon the new association he was going to
create. Visions of a strange, bewildering city where the honour of
women as well as the ownership of goods would be held as common
property are conjured up at the mention of that word. Our
exposition of his system must obviously begin with an examination
of the Phalanstère, upon the understanding of which everything
turns.</p>

<h5 id="heading30">1. <span class="smcap">The Phalanstère</span></h5>

<p>As a matter of fact nothing could be more peaceful than the
prospect which the Phalanstère presents to our view. Anything
more closely resembling Owen’s New Harmony or Cabet’s Icaria or
Campanella’s Civitas Solis or More’s Utopia would be difficult to
imagine. Externally it looks for all the world like a grand hotel—a
Palace Hotel on a gigantic scale with 1500 persons <i>en pension</i>. One
is instinctively reminded of those familiar structures which have
lately become such a feature of all summer and winter resorts, containing
all manner of rooms and apartments, concert halls and
lecture rooms, etc. All of this is described by Fourier with the
minutest detail. No restrictions would be placed upon individual
liberty. Anyone so choosing could have a suite of rooms for himself,
and enjoy his meals in the privacy of his own room—that is, if he
preferred it to the <i>table d’hôte</i>. Hotel life is generally open only
to the few. The Phalanstère would have rooms and tables at
all prices to suit all five classes of society, with a free table in
addition.</p>

<p>A number of people living under the same roof and eating at the
same table, and adopting this as their normal everyday method of
living, sums up the element of communism which the scheme contained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
And the question is naturally asked, Why should Fourier
attach such supreme importance to this mode of existence as to make
it the <i>sine qua non</i> of his whole system and the key to any solution
of the problem? The answer lies in the conviction, which he fully
shared with Owen, that no solution is possible until the environment
is changed, and so changed that an entirely new type of man will
result from it.</p>

<p>Economically, of course, life under the same roof can offer to the
consumer the maximum of comfort at a minimum of cost. Cooking,
heating, lighting, etc., would under such conditions be cheaper and
more efficient, and all the worries and anxieties of individual housekeeping
would be swept aside.</p>

<p>Socially a common life of this kind would gradually teach different
persons to appreciate one another. Sympathy would take the place
of mutual antipathy, which under the present <i>régime</i>, as Fourier
eloquently remarks, shows an “ascending scale of hatred and a
descending scale of contempt.” Besides, the multiplicity of relations
and interests, and even of intrigues, which would occasionally
enliven this little world would at any rate make life more interesting.</p>

<p>On this double series of advantages Fourier is quite inexhaustible.
He reckons up the economies with the painstaking care of an old
clerk, and boasts the superiority of the <i>table d’hôte</i> over the family
meal with the enthusiasm of an old bachelor. The social and moral
advantages seem somewhat more doubtful. It is not very obvious
that contact with the rich would make the poor more polished or
amicable, nor is it very clear that either would be much happier for
it. Fourier’s Utopia is already in operation in the United States,
where, owing to the increase in the cost of living, the economic
advantages of a communal life are more fully taken advantage of.
Not only are there a great number of bachelors living at the clubs,
but young couples have recently made a practice of taking up
their abode at the hotels. They are already on the way to the
Phalanstère.</p>

<p>This shows that Fourier was considerably in advance of his time,
and those who hold that doctrines, after all, are always suggested
by facts would find it difficult to discover anything pointing towards
such communal experiments in the earlier part of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>His solution of the servant problem, which is becoming more
difficult every day, is one that is likely to be adopted in the
near future. His suggestion was the substitution of collective for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
individual services as being more compatible with human dignity
and independence, and the development of industrial rather than
domestic production. This has already taken place in the case of
bread-making and laundry work, and there are signs of its extension
to house-sweeping (by means of the vacuum cleaner), carpet-cleaning,
etc. A further extension to the art of cooking may also be
expected.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<h5 id="heading31">2. <span class="smcap">Integral Co-operation</span></h5>

<p>Careful scrutiny of the internal arrangements of the Phalanstère
shows it to be something other than an ordinary hotel after all. It
may perhaps be regarded as a kind of co-operative hotel, belonging
to an association and accommodating members of that association
only. It is much more thoroughgoing than the ordinary co-operative
society, which is just content to buy commodities as an association
without making any real attempt to practise communism,
except in those rare cases where a co-operative restaurant is set up
alongside of a co-operative warehouse.</p>

<p>The “Phalange,” not content to remain a mere consumers’
association, was to attempt production as well. Around the hotel
was to be an area of 400 acres, with farm buildings and industrial
establishments that were to supply the needs of the inmates. The
Phalange was to be a small self-sufficing world, a microcosm
producing everything it consumed, and consuming—as far as it
could—all it produced. Occasionally, no doubt, there would be
occasional surpluses or some needs would remain unsatisfied, and
then recourse would be had to exchange with other Phalanges.
Every Phalange was to be established as a kind of joint-stock company.
Private property was not to be extinguished altogether, but
to be transformed into the holding of stock—a transformation of a
capitalistic rather than of a socialistic nature. M. de Molinari states
that the future will witness the almost universal application of the
joint-stock principle, and he for one would welcome its extension.
Fourier has forestalled his prophecy by three-quarters of a century,
with an insight that is truly remarkable for the time in which he
wrote, for joint-stock undertakings were then exceedingly rare. He
enumerates the many advantages which would result from such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
transformation in the nature of property, and he roundly declares
that “a share in such concerns is really more valuable than any
amount of land or money.”</p>

<p>How were the extravagant dividends which he promised when
propounding his scheme to be paid out? The usual method in
financial and commercial transactions is to distribute them according
to the holding of each individual. But such was not to be his plan.
Capital was to have a third of the profits, labour five-twelfths, and
ability three-twelfths. “Ability,” which signifies the work of
management, was to devolve upon those individuals who were chosen
by the society and were considered best fitted for the work. Fourier
never realised that there was a possibility of the wrong man being
chosen. He had no experience of universal suffrage, and he believed
that within such a tiny group the election would be perfectly <i>bona-fide</i>.</p>

<p>Associations known as Phalanges have actually been established
in Paris, and to some extent at any rate they have realised the ideal
as outlined by Fourier. The profits are divided in almost strict
accordance with Fourier’s formula,<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> and in order to emphasise their
descent from him the members have caused a statue to be raised to
his memory in their quarter of the town—the Boulevard de Clichy.</p>

<p>Not content with giving us an outline of a co-operative productive
society, Fourier has also left us an admirably concise statement
of the problem that faces modern society. “The first problem for
the economist to solve,” says he, “is to discover some way of transforming
the wage-earner into a co-operative owner.”<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The necessity for such transformation consists in the fact that
this is the only way of making labour at once attractive and productive,
for “the sense of property is still the strongest lever in
civilised society.”<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> “The poor individual in Harmony who only
possesses a portion of a share, say a twentieth, is a part proprietor
of the whole concern. He can speak of <i>our</i> land, <i>our</i> palaces and
castles, <i>our</i> forests and factories, for all of them belong partly to
him.”<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> “Hence the <i>rôle</i> of capitalist and proprietor are synonymous
in Harmony.”<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The worker will draw his share of the profits not merely as a
worker, but also as a capitalist who is a shareholder in the concern,
and as a member of the directorate, in which every shareholder has
a voice. The administration of the business will form a part of his
responsibilities. It is just what we are accustomed to call co-partnership.
He will, moreover, participate in the privileges and
management of the Phalange as a member of a consumers’ association.</p>

<p>All this seems very complicated, but it was a part of Fourier’s
policy to transmute the divergent interests of capitalists, workers,
and consumers by giving to each individual a share in these conflicting
interests.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Under existing conditions they are in conflict
with one another simply because they are focused in different
individuals. Were they to be united in the same person the conflict
would cease, or at any rate the battle-ground would be shifted to the
conscience of each individual, where reconciliation would not be
quite such a difficult matter.</p>

<p>A programme which aims, not at the abolition of property, but
at the extinction of the wage-earner by giving him the right of
holding property on the joint-stock principle, which looks to succeed,
not by advocating class war, but by fostering co-operation of capital
with labour and managing ability, and attempts to reconcile the
conflicting interests of capitalist and worker, of producer and
consumer, debtor and creditor, by welding those interests together
in one and the same person, is by no means commonplace. Such
was the ideal of the French working classes until Marxian collectivism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
took its place, and it is quite possible that its deposition may be
only temporary after all. The programme which the Radical
Socialists swear allegiance to, and which they set against the purely
socialistic programme, is the maintenance and extension of private
property and the abolition of the wage-earner. By taking this
attitude they are unconsciously following in the wake of Fourier.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<h5 id="heading32">3. <span class="smcap">Back to the Land</span></h5>

<p>The title at the head of this section is to-day adopted as a motto
by several social schools. It also figured in Fourier’s programme
long ago. Fourier, however, employed the phrase in a double sense.</p>

<p>In the first place, he thought that there must be a dispersion of
the big cities and a spreading out of their inhabitants in Phalanstères,
which would simply mean moderate-sized villages with a population
of 1600 people, or 400 families. Great care was to be exercised
in choosing a suitable site. Wherever possible the village was to
be placed on the bank of a beautiful river, with hills surrounding
it, the slopes of which would yield to cultivation, the whole area
being flanked by a deep forest. It was not, as some one has remarked,
intended as an Arcadia for better-class clerks.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> It was simply an
anticipation of the garden cities which disciples of Ruskin and Morris
are building all over England. These are designed, as we know, not
merely with a view to promoting health and an appreciation of beauty,
but also to encouraging the amenities of life and to solving the
question of housing by counteracting the high rental of urban land.</p>

<p>In the second place, industrial work of every description, factory
and machine production of every kind, were to be reduced to the
indispensable minimum—a condition that was absolutely necessary
if the first reform was ever to become practicable. Contrary to
what might have been expected, Fourier felt no antipathy towards
capitalism, but entertained the greatest contempt for industrialism,
which is hardly the same thing.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> A return to the land, if it was to
mean anything at all, was to mean more agriculture. But care
must be taken not to interpret it in the old sense of tillage or the
cultivation of cereals. It was in no measured terms that he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of the cultivation of corn and the production of bread, which has
caused mankind to bend under the cruellest yoke and for the coarsest
nourishment that history knows. The only attractive forms of
cultivation, in his opinion, were horticulture and arboriculture, apple-growing,
etc., joined, perhaps, with poultry-keeping and such occupations
as generally fall to the lot of the small-holder.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> The inhabitant
of the Phalanstère would be employed almost exclusively in looking
after his garden, just as Adam was before the Fall and Candide
after his misfortunes.</p>

<h5 id="heading33">4. <span class="smcap">Attractive Labour</span></h5>

<p>The attractiveness of labour was made the pivot of Fourier’s
system. Wherever we like to look, whether in the direction of
so-called civilised societies or towards barbarian or servile communities,
labour is everywhere regarded as a curse. There is no
reason why it should be, and in the society of the future it certainly
will not be, for men will then labour not because they are constrained
to either by force or by the pressure of need or the allurement of
self-interest. Fourier’s ideal was a social State in which men would
no longer be forced to work, whether from the necessity of earning
their daily bread or from a desire for gain or from a sense of social
or religious duty. His ambition was to see men work for the mere
love of work, hastening to their task as they do to a gala. Why
should not labour become play, and why should not the same degree
of enthusiasm be shown for work as is shown by youth in the
pursuit of sport?<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>Fourier thinks this would be possible if everyone were certain
that he would get a minimum of subsistence by his work. Labour
would lose all its coercive features, and would be regarded simply
as an opportunity for exercising certain faculties, provided sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
liberty were given everyone to choose that kind of work which
suited him best, and provided also the labour were sufficiently
diversified in character to stimulate imagination and were carried
on in an atmosphere of joy and beauty. The sole object of the
Phalanstère, as we have already seen, was to make labour more
attractive by creating a new kind of social life in which production
as well as distribution would be on a co-operative basis and horticulture
would take the place of agriculture. But Fourier was not
content to stop at that, and he proceeds to show the importance of
combining different kinds of employment. Some of his suggestions
are very ingenious; others, on the other hand, are equally puerile.
The most notable of these is his proposal to bring individuals together
into what he calls groups and series. A person would be allowed to
join these groups according to his own individual preferences, and
as it would not involve his spending his whole life in any one of them,
he would be free to “flit” from one to the other.</p>

<p class="tb">But it is about time we took leave of our guide. We cannot
pretend to follow the twists and turns of his labyrinthine psychology,
with its dozen passions, of which the three fundamental ones are
the desire for change, for order, and for secrecy; nor can we bring
ourselves to accept his theodicy, nor his views on climatic and cosmogenic
evolution, which was some day to result in sweetening the waters
of the ocean, in melting the polar glaciers, in giving birth to new
animals, and in putting us in communication with other planets.
Yet even this muddy torrent is not without some grain of gold in it.</p>

<p>Take the question of education, for example, which holds a very
prominent place in his writings. Old bachelor that he was, he never
cared very much for children, but he nevertheless foreshadowed the development
of modern education on several important points. Froebel,
who conceived the idea of the kindergarten (1837), was among his
disciples.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>His teaching on the sex question bears all the marks of lax
morality, and indicates the fallacy of thinking that untrained
passions and instincts can be morally justified.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> His extreme views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
on this question, which even go beyond the advocacy of free union,
have contributed a great deal to the downfall of Fourierism. Paul
Janet remarks somewhere that the socialists have not been very
happy in their treatment of the woman question, and we have already
shown how this weakness led to the downfall of Saint-Simonism.
But even on this subject Fourier has penned a few pithy sentences.
“As a general rule,” he says, “it may be said that true social
progress is always accompanied by the fuller emancipation of
woman, and there is no more certain evidence of decadence than the
gradual servility of women. Other events undoubtedly influence
political movements, but there is no other cause that begets social
progress or social decline with the same rapidity as a change in the
status of women.”<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Unfortunately his feminism was not so much
inspired by respect for the dignity of woman as by his hatred of
family life, and the liberty which he thought to be the true test of
progress was generally nothing better than free love.</p>

<p>The anti-militarists have good claim to regard him as a forerunner.
Speaking of present-day society, he said that “it consists
of a minority of armed slaves who hold dominion over a majority
of disarmed.”</p>

<p>It was not Fourier’s intention to introduce men into the world
of Harmony at one stroke. He thought that as an indispensable
preliminary they should go through a stage of transition which he
calls <i>Garantisme</i>, where each one would be given a minimum of
subsistence, security, and comfort—in short, everything that is
considered necessary by the advocates of working-class reform.</p>

<p>Fourierism never enjoyed the prestige and never exercised the
influence which Saint-Simonism did, but its action, though less
startling, and confined as it was to a narrower sphere, has not been
less durable. Nothing has been heard of Saint-Simonism these last
fifty years, but there is still a Phalanstère school. It is not very
numerous, perhaps, if we are only to reckon those who formally
adhere to the doctrine, but if we take into consideration the co-operative
movement, as we ought at least to some extent, it is seen
to be very powerful still. For a long time Fourier’s ideas were
scouted by everybody, but during the last fifteen years much more
sympathetic attention has been given them.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>Among his disciples there are at any rate two who deserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
special mention. Victor Considérant, one of the strongest advocates
of Fourierism, has left us the best exposition of the
doctrine that we have, in his book <i>Doctrine sociale</i> (1834-44). Like
Owen, he experimented in American colonisation,<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> and gained a
measure of notoriety in the Revolution of 1848 by insisting upon
the right to work as a necessary compensation for the loss of
property.</p>

<p>André Godin left a monument more permanent than books, in
the famous Familistère which was founded by him. It consists of
an establishment for the manufacture of heating apparatus at
Guise, run entirely on co-partnership lines, the profits being distributed
in accordance with the rules of the master.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> It is not a
new co-operative society of the humdrum kind, however. Close to
the works, right in the middle of a beautiful park, are one or two
huge blocks which contain the “flats” where the co-partners live,
as well as schools, <i>crèches</i>, a theatre, and a co-operative stores. But
despite its fame, and notwithstanding the fact that it has become a
kind of rendezvous for co-operators all the world over, there is
nothing very attractive about it, and if one wants to get a good idea
of what a real Phalanstère is like it is better to visit either Bournville
or Port Sunlight, or Agneta Park in Holland.</p>

<h4 id="heading34">III: LOUIS BLANC</h4>

<p>It is not the most original work that always attracts most attention.
Stuart Mill, writing of Saint-Simonism and Fourierism, claims that
“they may justly be counted among the most remarkable productions
of the past and present age.” To apply such terms to the
writings of Louis Blanc would be entirely out of place. His predecessors’
works, despite a certain mediocrity, are redeemed by
occasional remarks of great penetration; but there is none of that
in Louis Blanc’s. Moreover, his treatment is very slight, the whole
exposition occupying about as much space as an ordinary review<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
article.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> And there is no evidence of exceptional originality, for the
sources of its inspiration must be sought elsewhere—in the writings
of Saint-Simon, of Fourier, of Sismondi, and of Buonarotti, one of
the survivors of the Babeuf conspiracy,<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> and in the democratic
doctrines of 1793. In short, Blanc was content to give a convenient
exposition of such socialistic ideas as the public had become
accustomed to since the Restoration.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, no sooner was the <i>Organisation du Travail</i> published
in 1841 than it was read and discussed by almost everybody. Several
editions followed one another in rapid succession. The title, which
is borrowed from the Saint-Simonians, supplied one of those popular
formulæ which conveniently summed up the grievances of the
working classes in 1848, and during the February Revolution Louis
Blanc came to be regarded as the best qualified exponent of the
views of the proletariat. Even for a long time after 1848 the work
was considered to be the most characteristic specimen of French
socialistic writing.</p>

<p>Its success was in a measure due to the circumstances of the
period. The brevity of the book and the directness of the exposition
made the discussion of the theme a comparatively easy matter.
The personal notoriety of the author also had a great deal to do with
the interest which his work aroused. During the short career of the
July monarchy, Blanc, both in the press and on the platform, had
found himself one of the most valiant supporters of the advanced
democratic wing. His <i>Histoire de Dix Ans</i> gave him some standing
as a historian. Later on the <i>rôle</i> which he played as a member of
the Provisional Government of 1848, and afterwards at the inauguration
of the Third Republic, contributed to his fame as a public man.
And, last of all, his unfortunate experience in connection with the
failure of the national workshops, for which he was unjustly blamed,
added to the interest which the public took in him.</p>

<p>All this, however, would not justify his inclusion in our history
were it not for other reasons which give to the <i>Organisation du
Travail</i> something more than a mere passing interest.</p>

<p>In no other work is the opposition between competition and
association so trenchantly stated. Every economic evil, if we are
to believe Blanc, is the outcome of competition. Competition affords
an explanation of poverty and of moral degradation, of the growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
crime and the prevalence of prostitution, of industrial crises and
international feuds. “In the first place,” writes Blanc, “we shall
show how competition means extermination for the proletariat, and
in the second place how it spells poverty and ruin for the <i>bourgeoisie</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>
The proof spreads itself out over the whole work, and is based upon
varied examples gleaned from newspapers and official inquiries,
from economic treatises and Government statistics, as well as from
personal observations carried on by Blanc himself. No effort is
spared to make the most disagreeable facts contribute of their
testimony. Everything is arranged with a view to one aim—the
condemnation of competition. Only one conclusion seems possible:
“If you want to get rid of the terrible effects of competition you
must remove it root and branch and begin to build anew, with
association as the foundation of your social life.”</p>

<p>Louis Blanc thus belonged to that group of socialists who thought
that voluntary associations would satisfy all the needs of society.
But he thinks of association in a somewhat different fashion from
his predecessors. He dreams neither of New Harmony nor of a
Phalanstère. Neither does he conceive of the economic world of the
future as a series of groups, each of which forms a complete society
in itself. Fourier’s integral co-operation, where the Phalanstère was
to supply all the needs of its members, is ignored altogether. His
proposal is a social workshop, which simply means a co-operative
producers’ society. The social workshop was intended simply to
combine members of the same trade, and is distinguished from the
ordinary workshop by being more democratic and equalitarian.
Unlike Fourierism, it does not contain within itself all aspects of
economic life. By no means self-contained, it merely undertakes
the production of some economic good, which other folk are expected
to buy in the ordinary way. Louis Blanc’s is simply the commonest
type of co-operative society.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> The schemes of both Owen and
Fourier were much more ambitious, and attempted to apply the
principle of co-operation to consumption as well as to production.</p>

<p>Nor was the idea altogether a new one. A Saint-Simonian of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
name of Buchez had already in 1831<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> made a similar proposal, but
it met with little success. Workers in the same trade—carpenters,
masons, shoemakers, or what not—were advised to combine together,
to throw their tools into the common lot, and to distribute among
themselves the profits which had hitherto gone to the <i>entrepreneur</i>.
A fifth of the annual profits was to be laid aside to build up a
“perpetual inalienable reserve,” which would thus grow regularly
every year. “Without some such fund,” says Buchez, with
an unerring instinct for the future, “association will become
little better than other commercial undertakings. It will prove
beneficial to the founders only, and will ban everyone who is not
an original shareholder, for those who had a share in the concern
at the beginning will employ their privileges in exploiting others.”<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
Such is the destiny that awaits more than one co-operative society,
where the founders become mere shareholders and employ others
who are simply hirelings to do the work for them.</p>

<p>Whereas Buchez was greatly interested in <i>petite</i> industry,<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Blanc
was in favour of the great industry, and that seems to be the only
difference between his social workshop and an ordinary co-operative
society. But in Blanc’s opinion the social workshop was just a
cell out of which a complete collectivistic society would some day
issue forth. Its ultimate destiny did not really interest him very
much. The ideal was much too vague and too distant to be profitably
discussed. The important thing was to make a beginning
and to prepare for the future in a thoroughly practical fashion, but
“without breaking altogether with the past.” That seemed clearly
to be the line of procedure. To give an outline of what that future
would be like seemed a vain desire, and would simply mean outlining
another Utopia.</p>

<p>It is just because his plan was precise and simple that Louis
Blanc succeeded in claiming attention where so many beautiful but
quite impossible dreams had failed. Here at last was a project
which everyone could understand, and which, further, would not be
very difficult to adopt. This passion for the concrete rather than
the ideal, for some practical formula that might possibly point the
way out of the morass of <i>laissez-faire</i>, may be discovered in more
than one of his contemporaries. It is very pronounced in Vidal’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
work, for example. Vidal was the author of an interesting book on
distribution which unfortunately seems to be now quite forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
Much of the success of the project, like that of the State Socialism
of a later period, was undoubtedly due to this feeling.</p>

<p>The projected reform seemed exceptionally simple. A national
workshop was to be set up forthwith in which all branches of production
would be represented. The necessary capital was to be
obtained from the Government, which was expected to borrow it.
Every worker who could give the necessary moral guarantee was
allowed to compete for this capital. Wages would be equal for
everybody, a thing which is quite impossible under present conditions,
largely because of the false anti-social character of a good deal of
our education. In the future, when a new system of education
will have improved morality and begotten new ideas, the proposal
will seem a perfectly natural one. Here we come across a suggestion
that seems common to all the associationists, namely, the idea of a
new environment effecting a revolution in the ordinary motives of
mankind. As to the hierarchy of the workshop, that will be established
by election, except during the first year, when the Government
will undertake to conduct the organisation, because as yet the
members will hardly be sufficiently trained to choose the best representatives.
The net revenue will be divided into three portions, of
which the first will be distributed between the various members of
the association, thus contributing to a rise in their wages; the second
portion will go towards the upkeep of the old, the sick, and the infirm,
and towards easing the burdens of some other industries; while the
third portion will be spent in supplying tools to those who wish to
join the association, which will gradually extend its sway over the
whole of society. The last suggestion inevitably reminds us of
Buchez’s “inalienable and perpetual capital.”</p>

<p>Interest will be paid on the capital employed in founding the
industry, such interest being guaranteed against taxation. But we
must not conclude that Blanc favoured this condition because he
believed in the legitimacy of interest, as Fourier did. He was too
pronounced a disciple of the Saint-Simonians ever to admit that
it was legitimate. The time will come, he thinks, when it will no
longer be necessary, but he gives no hint as to how to get rid of it.
For the present at any rate it must be paid, were it only to enable
the transition to be made. “We need not with savage impatience
destroy everything that has been founded upon the abuses which
as a whole we are so anxious to remove.” The interest paid, along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with the wages, will form a part of the cost of production. The
capitalists, however, will have no share in the net profit unless they
have directly contributed to it.</p>

<p>It seems that the only difference between the social workshop
and the present factory is its somewhat more democratic organisation,
and the fact that the workers themselves seize all the profit
(<i>i.e.</i> over and above net interest), instead of leaving it, as was hitherto
the case, to the <i>entrepreneur</i>.</p>

<p>But this social workshop, as we have said, is a mere cell out of
which a new society is expected to form. The amusing feature is
this, that the new society can only come into being through the
activity of competition—competition purged of all its more abominable
features, that is to say. “The arm of competition must be
strengthened in order to get rid of competition.” That ought not
to be a very difficult task, for the “social workshop as compared
with the ordinary private factory will effect greater economies and
have a better system of organisation, for every worker without
exception will be interested in honestly performing his duty as
quickly as possible.” On every side will private enterprise find
itself threatened by the new system. Capital and workers will
gravitate towards the social workshop with its greater advantages.
Nor will the movement cease until one vast association has been
formed representing all the social shops in the same industry. Every
important industry will be grouped round some central factory, and
“the different shops will be of the nature of supplementary establishments.”
To crown the edifice, the different industries will be grouped
together, and, instead of competing with one another, will materially
help and support each other, especially during a time of crisis, so
that the understanding existing between them will achieve a still
more remarkable success in preventing crises altogether.</p>

<p>Thus by merely giving it greater freedom the competitive <i>régime</i>
will gradually disappear, to make way for the associative <i>régime</i>,
and as the social workshops realise these wonderful ideals the evils
of competition will disappear, and moral and social life will be
cleansed of its present evils.</p>

<p>The remarkable feature of the whole scheme is that hardly
anything new is needed to effect this vast change. Just a little
additional pressure on the part of Government, some capital to
set up the workshops, and a few additional regulations to guide
it in its operations, that is all.</p>

<p>This is really a very important point in Louis Blanc’s doctrine,
which clearly differentiates it both from Owen’s and Fourier’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
They appeared to think that the State was not necessary at all:
private initiative seemed quite sufficient. It was hoped that society
would renew itself spontaneously without any extraneous aid, and
this is still the working creed of the co-operative movement.
Wherever the co-operative movement has flourished the result has
been entirely due to the efforts of its members. But Louis Blanc’s
attention was centred on the highly trained artisan, and the problem
was to find capital to employ him. Were they to rely upon their
own savings, they would never make a beginning.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Moreover, somebody
must start the thing, and power is wanted for this. That power
will be organised force, which will be employed, however, not so
much as an ally, but rather as a “starter.” Intervention will necessarily
be only temporary. Once the scheme is started its own
momentum will keep it going. The State, so to speak, “will just
give it a push: gravity and the laws of mechanics will suffice for
the rest.” That is just where the ingenuity of the whole system
comes in, and as a matter of fact the majority of the producing co-operative
societies now at work owe their existence to the financial
aid and administrative ability of public bodies, without which they
could hardly keep going.</p>

<p>Louis Blanc, accordingly, is one of the first socialists to take
care to place the burden of reform upon the shoulders of the State.
Rodbertus and Lassalle make an exactly analogous appeal to the
State, and for this reason the French writer deserves a place among
the pioneers of State Socialism.</p>

<p>This appeal of the socialists is beautifully naïve. On the one
hand they invite the adherence of Government to a proposal that is
frankly revolutionary, in which case it is asked to compass its own
destruction—naturally not a very attractive prospect. On the
other hand the project seems harmless enough, and the support
which the Government is asked to extend further emphasises the
modest nature of the undertaking. State socialism cannot escape
the horns of this dilemma by proclaiming itself frankly conservative,
as it has done in Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Louis Blanc, like Lassalle after him, was much concerned with
immediate results, and he failed to notice this objection. He paid
considerable attention to another line of criticism, however, and
one that he considered much more dangerous. He sought a way
of escape by using an argument which was afterwards frequently
employed by the State Socialists, as we shall see by and by.</p>

<p>The question was whether State intervention is contrary to
liberty or not. “It clearly is,” says Louis Blanc, “if you conceive
of liberty as an abstract right which is conferred upon man by the
terms of some constitution or other. But that is no real liberty at
all. Full liberty consists of the power which man has of developing
and exercising his faculties with the sanction of justice, and the
approval of law.”<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> The right to liberty without the opportunity
of exercising it is simply oppression, and wherever man is ignorant
or without tools he inevitably has to submit to those who are either
richer or better taught than himself, and his liberty is gone. In
such cases State intervention is really necessary, just as it is in the
case of inferior classes or minors. Lacordaire’s saying is more pithy
still: “As between the weak and the strong, liberty oppresses and
law sets free.” Sismondi had already employed this argument, and
much capital has been made of it by every opponent of laissez-faire.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>In the writings of Louis Blanc may be found the earliest faint
outline of a movement that had assumed considerable proportions
before the end of the century. State socialism, which was as yet a
temporary expedient, by and by becomes an important economic
doctrine with numerous practical applications.</p>

<p>The events of 1848 gave Louis Blanc an opportunity of partly
realising his ideas. We shall speak of these experiments when we
come to discuss the misdirected efforts of the 1848 socialists. But
the ideas outlined in the <i>Organisation du Travail</i> were destined to a
more permanent success in the numerous co-operative productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
societies which were founded as a result of its teaching. They are
still quite popular with a certain class of French working men.</p>

<p>Though inferior to both Fourier and Owen, Blanc gave considerable
impetus to the Associative movement, and quite deserves his
place among the Associative socialists.</p>

<p class="tb">Beside Louis Blanc it may be convenient to refer to two other
writers, Leroux and Cabet, who took part in the same movement
right up to the Revolution of 1848.</p>

<p>Pierre Leroux exercised considerable influence over his contemporaries.
George Sand’s works are full of social dissertations, and
she herself declares that most of these she owed to Leroux. However,
one can hardly get anything of the nature of a definite contribution
to the science from his own writings, which are vaguely
humanitarian in character. We must make an exception, perhaps,
of his advocacy of association,<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> and especially of the idea of solidarity,
a word that has been exceedingly fortunate in its career. Indeed,
it seems that he was the first to employ this famous term in the
sense in which it is used to-day—as a substitute for charity.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>Apparently, also, he was the first to contrast the word “socialism”
with its antithesis “individualism.”<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> The invention of these two
terms is enough to save his name from oblivion in the opinion of
every true sociologist.</p>

<p>Cabet had one experience which is rare for a socialist: he had
filled the office of Attorney-General, though only for a short time
it is true. Far greater celebrity came to him from the publication
of his novel, <i>Le Voyage en Icarie</i>. There is nothing very original in
the system outlined there. He gives the usual easy retort to those
who question him concerning the fate of idlers in Icaria: “Of idlers
in Icaria there will be none.” In his enthusiasm for his ideal he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
went farther than either Owen or Considérant by personally superintending
the founding of a colony in the United States (1848).
Despite many a grievous trial the settlement managed to exist for
fifty years, finally coming to grief in 1898.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>Cabet is frankly communistic, and in that respect resembles
Owen rather than Fourier, although he always considered himself a
disciple of the latter. But this was perhaps due to his admiration
for Fourier, with whom he was personally very well acquainted.
Although he was a communist he was no revolutionist. He was a
good-natured fellow who believed in making his appeal to the
altruistic feelings of men, and was sufficiently optimistic to believe
that moral conversion was not a difficult process.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV_FRIEDRICH_LIST_AND_THE">CHAPTER IV: FRIEDRICH LIST AND THE
NATIONAL SYSTEM OF POLITICAL ECONOMY</h3>

<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century the doctrine of Adam
Smith had conquered the whole of Europe. Former theories were
forgotten and no rival had appeared to challenge its supremacy. But
during the course of its triumphant march it had undergone many
changes and had been subjected to much criticism. Even disciples
like Say and Malthus, and Ricardo especially, had contributed many
important additions and effected much improvement. Through the
influence of Sismondi and the socialists new points of view had been
gained, involving a departure from the narrow outlook of the master
in the direction of newer and broader horizons.</p>

<p>Of the principles of the Classical school the Free Trade theory
was the only one which still remained intact. This, however,
was the most important of all. Here the triumph had been complete.
Freedom of international trade was accepted as a sacred
doctrine by the economists of every country. In Germany as in
England, in France as in Russia, there was complete unanimity among
scientific authorities. The socialists at first neglected this topic, and
when they did mention it it was to express their complete approval
of the orthodox view.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> A few isolated authors might have hinted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
reservations or objections, but they never caught the public ear.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
It is true that Parliaments and Governments in many countries
hesitated to put these new ideas into practice. But even here,
despite the strength of the opposing forces, one can see the growing
influence of Smith’s doctrine. The liberal tariff of Prussia in 1818,
the reforms of Huskisson in England (1824-27), were expressly
conceived by their authors as partial applications of those principles.</p>

<p>However, there arose in Germany a new doctrine for which the
peculiar economic and political conditions of that country at the
beginning of the nineteenth century afforded a favourable environment.
Although the development was slow it was none the less
startling. Friedrich List, in his work entitled <i>Das Nationale System
der Politischen Oekonomie</i>, promulgated the theory of the new Protection.
“The history of my book,” he remarks in his preface, “is
the history of half my life.” He might have added that it was also
the history of Germany from 1800 to 1840. It was no mere coincidence
that led to the creation of an economic system based
exclusively upon the conception of nationality in that country,
where the dominant political note throughout the nineteenth century
was the realisation of national unity. List’s work was a product
of circumstances, and these circumstances we must understand if
we are to judge of the author and his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="heading35">I: LIST’S IDEAS IN RELATION TO THE ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS IN GERMANY</h4>

<p>The Germany of the nineteenth century presents a unique spectacle.
Her population was at first essentially agricultural, and the
various states politically and economically isolated. Her industry
was fettered by the corporative <i>régime</i>, and her agriculture was still
in feudal thraldom. Freed from these encumbrances, and having
established first her economic and then her political unity, she took
her place during the last three decades of the century among the
foremost of industrial Powers.</p>

<p>The Act of Union of 1800 had ensured the economic unity of the
British Isles. The union of England and Scotland was already a
century old, and Smith regarded it as “one of the chief causes of the
prosperity of Great Britain.”<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> France had accomplished the same
end by the suppression of domestic tariffs in 1791. But Germany
even in 1815 was still a congeries of provinces, varying in importance
and separated from one another by tariff walls. List, in
the petition which he addressed in 1819 to the Federal Assembly in
the name of the General Federation of German Trade and Commerce,
could reckon no less than thirty-eight kinds of tariffs within
the German Confederacy, without mentioning other barriers to
commerce. In Prussia alone there were no fewer than sixty-seven
different tariffs.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> “In short,” says List in another petition, “while
other nations cultivate the sciences and the arts whereby commerce
and industry are extended, German merchants and manufacturers
must devote a great part of their time to the study of domestic
tariffs and taxes.”<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>These inconveniences were still further aggravated by the complete
absence of import duties. The German states were closed to
one another, but, owing to the absence of effective central control, were
open to other nations—a peculiarly galling situation on the morrow
of the Continental Blockade. The peace treaty was scarcely signed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
when England—so long cut off from her markets and forced to over-stock
her warehouses with her manufactured goods—began to flood
the Continent with her products. Driven from France by the protective
tariff established by the Restoration Government, these goods,
offered at ridiculously low prices, found a ready market in Germany.</p>

<p>The German merchants and manufacturers became thoroughly
alarmed, and there arose a general demand for economic unity and a
uniform tariff. Public opinion urged a reform which appeared to
be the first step in the movement towards national unity. In 1818
Prussia secured her own commercial unity by abolishing all internal
taxation, retaining only those duties which were levied at the
frontier. Her new tariff of 10 per cent. on manufactured goods,
with free entrance for raw material, was not regarded as prohibitive,
and was actually approved of by Huskisson as a model which the
British Parliament might well imitate. But this reform, confined as
it was to Prussia alone, did nothing to improve the lot of the German
merchants elsewhere, for the Prussian tariff applied just as much to
them as to foreigners.</p>

<p>This particular reform, far from staying the movement towards
uniform import duties, only accelerated it. A General Association
of German Manufacturers and Merchants was founded at Frankfort
in 1819 to urge confederation upon the Government. The agitation
was inspired by Friedrich List. He had been for a short time professor
at Tübingen and was already well known as a journalist. He
was nominated general secretary of the association, and became the
soul of the movement. He wrote endless petitions and articles, and
made personal application to the various Governments at Munich,
Stuttgart, Berlin, and Vienna. He was anxious that Austria should
take the lead. But all in vain. The Federal Assembly, hostile as
it was to every manifestation of public opinion, refused to reply to
the petition of the merchants and manufacturers. List himself was
soon taken up with other interests. He was named as the deputy
for Reutlingen, his native town, in the state of Würtemberg, in 1820,
but was banished from the Assembly and condemned to ten months’
imprisonment for criticising the bureaucracy of his own country.
After seeking refuge in France he spent a few years travelling in
England and Switzerland, and then returned to Würtemberg, where
he again suffered imprisonment. Upon his release from prison he
resolved to emigrate to America, where Lafayette, whom he had
met in Paris, promised him a warm welcome.</p>

<p>Returning to Germany in 1832, after having made numerous
friends and accumulated a fortune, he found the tariff movement for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
which he had struggled thirteen years before just coming to a head.
It was to be established, however, in a fashion quite different from
what he had expected. It was not to be a general reform, and
Austria was not to be leader. Prussia was to be the pivot of the
movement, which was to be accomplished by means of a series of
general agreements. In 1828 there were formed almost simultaneously
two Tariff Unions, the one between Bavaria and Würtemberg, the
other between Prussia and Hesse-Darmstadt. Within the areas of
both of these unions goods were to circulate freely, and a common
rate of duty was to be established at the frontiers. From the very
first there was a <i>rapprochement</i> between the unions, but a definite
fusion in one Zollverein was only decided upon on March 22, 1833.
The new <i>régime</i> actually came into being on January 1, 1834.
Even before that date Saxony and some of the other states had
already joined the new union.</p>

<p>Thus by 1834 the commercial union of modern Germany was
virtually accomplished. The Zollverein united the principal German
states,<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Austria excepted, and under this <i>régime</i> industry, assured
of a large domestic market, increased by leaps and bounds. But a
new problem presented itself, namely, what system of taxation was
to be adopted by the union as a whole. In 1834 the liberal Prussian
tariff of 1818 was adopted without much opposition, but nothing
more was attempted just then. Many of the manufacturers, however,
especially the iron-smelters and the cotton and flax spinners,
demanded a more substantial means of protection against foreign
competition. This clamour became more intense as the need for
iron and manufactured goods increased the demand for raw material.
Hence from 1841—the date of the completed Zollverein—a new
discussion arose between the partisans of the <i>status quo</i>, inclining
towards free exchange, and the advocates of a more vigorous
protection.</p>

<p>List’s <i>National System</i>, advocating Protection, appeared at the
psychological moment. This delightfully eloquent work is full of
examples borrowed from history and experience. The peculiar
condition of contemporary Germany was the one source of List’s
inspiration, and since the work was written for the public at large
it is remarkably free from all traces of the “schools.” Germany’s
industry, the sole hope of her future greatness, had found scope for
development only during the peace which followed 1815. It was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in its infancy, and found itself hard hit by the competition of
England, with her long experience, her perfected machinery, and
her gigantic output. This was the all-important fact for List.
England, whose rivalry appeared so dangerous, had closed her
markets to German agriculturists by her Corn Laws, while industrial
competition was out of the question. Two other nations, France
and the United States, destined, like Germany, to become great industrial
Powers, indicated the path of emancipation. France,
warned by the results of the Treaty of Eden (1786) as to the evils
of English competition, hastened to defend her fortunes by means of
prohibitive tariffs. Still more significant was the example of the
United States, whose situation was in all respects comparable with
that of Germany. In both cases economic independence was hardly
yet fully established, the natural resources were abundant, the
territory was vast, the population intelligent and industrious, with
the hope of a great political future. Though scarcely free as yet, the
Americans made the establishment of industry and the shutting out
of English goods by means of protective tariffs their first care. Thus
there was everywhere the same danger, the tyrannical supremacy
of England, and the same method of defence, Protection. Would
Germany alone stand aloof from adopting similar measures?</p>

<p>That is the essential point of List’s thesis. But these very practical
views tended to damage the well-known arguments of those
economists whom List refers to collectively as “the school.” The
“school” maintained that nations as well as individuals should buy
in the cheapest markets and devote all their energies to producing
just those commodities which yield them the greatest gain. Industry
can only grow in proportion to the amount of capital saved, but a
protective <i>régime</i> hinders accumulation and so defeats its own end.
To overcome these objections it is not necessary to combat them
one by one, for the discussion may be carried to an entirely different
field. The “school” adopts a certain ideal of commercial policy
as the basis of its thesis, namely, the increase of consumable wealth,
or, as List puts it, in an awkward enough fashion, “the increase of
its exchangeable values.”<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> This fundamental point of view must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
be changed if we would avoid the consequences which naturally
follow from it. List realised this, and in his attempt to accomplish
the task he gave expression to new truths which make his book
one of lasting theoretical value and ensure for it an important place
in the history of economic doctrines.</p>

<p>In fact, he introduces two ideas that were new to current theory,
namely, the idea of nationality as contrasted with that of cosmopolitanism,
and the idea of productive power as contrasted with that of
exchange values. List’s whole system rests upon these two ideas.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) List accuses Adam Smith and his school of cosmopolitanism.
Their hypothesis rested on the belief that men were henceforth to
be united in one great community from which war would be banished.
On such a hypothesis humanity was merely the sum of its individuals.
Individual interests alone counted, and any interference with economic
liberty could never be justified. But between man and humanity
must be interpolated the history of nations, and the “school” had
forgotten this. Every man forms part of some nation, and his
prosperity to a large extent depends upon the political power of that
nation.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>Universal <i>entente</i> is doubtless a noble end to pursue, and we
ought to hasten its accomplishment. But nations to-day are of
unequal strength and have different interests, so that a definite union
could only benefit them if they met on a footing of equality. The
union might even only benefit one of them while the others became
dependent. Viewed in this new light, political economy becomes
the science which, by taking account of the actual interests and of
the particular condition of each nation, shows along what path each
may rise to that degree of economic culture at which union with
other civilised nations, accompanied by free exchange, might be both
possible and useful.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>List distinguishes several “degrees of culture,” or what we would
to-day call “economic stages,” and he even claims actual historical
sequence for his classification into the savage, the pastoral, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
agricultural, the agricultural-manufacturing, and the agricultural-manufacturing-commercial
stage.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> A nation becomes “normal”<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
only when it has attained the last stage. List understands by this
that such is the ideal that a nation ought to follow. As a matter of
fact he would allow it to possess a navy and to found colonies only
on condition that it kept up its foreign trade and extended its sphere
of influence. It is only at this stage that a nation can nourish a vast
population, ensure a complete development of the arts and sciences,
and retain its independence and power. The last two ideas constitute
the <i>sine qua non</i> of nationality.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Not all nations, it is true,
can pretend to this complete development. It requires a vast
territory, with abundant natural resources, and a temperate climate,
which itself aids the development of manufactures.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> But where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
these conditions are given then it becomes a nation’s first duty to
exert all its forces in order to attain this stage. Germany possessed
these desiderata to a remarkable degree. All that was needed was
an extension of territory, and List lays claim to Holland and Denmark
as a portion of Germany, declaring that their incorporation would
be regarded even by themselves as being both desirable and necessary.
Accordingly, he wished them to enter the Confederacy of their own
free will.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>Hence the aim of a commercial policy is no longer what it was for
Smith, viz. the enriching of a nation. It is a much more complex
ideal that List proposes, both historically and politically, but an ideal
which implies as a primary necessity the establishment of manufactures.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This necessity becomes apparent from still another point of
view. The estimate of a nation’s wealth should not be confined to one
particular moment. It is not enough that the labour and economy
of its citizens should at the present moment assure for it a great mass
of exchange values. It is also necessary that these resources of labour
and of economy should be safeguarded and that their future development
should be assured, for “the power of creating wealth is infinitely
more important than the wealth itself.” A nation should
concern itself with the growth of what List in a vague fashion calls
its productive forces even more than with the exchange values
which depend upon them.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Even a temporary sacrifice of the
second may be demanded for the sake of the first. In these expressions
List merely wishes to emphasise the distinction between a
policy which takes account of a nation’s future as compared with
one which takes account only of the present. “A nation must
sacrifice and give up a measure of material property in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to gain culture, skill, and powers of united production; it must
sacrifice some present advantages in order to ensure to itself future
ones.”<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>But what are these productive forces which constitute the permanent
source of a nation’s prosperity and the condition of its
progress?</p>

<p>With particular insistence List first of all mentions the moral
and political institutions, freedom of thought, freedom of conscience,
liberty of the press, trial by jury, publicity of justice, control of
administration, and parliamentary government. All these have a
stimulating and salutary effect upon labour. He is never weary of
recalling to mind the loss of wealth caused by the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes, or by the Spanish Inquisition, which, says he, “had
passed sentence of death upon the Spanish navy long ere the English
and the Dutch fleets had executed the decree” (p. 88). He unjustly<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
accuses Smith and his school of materialism, and condemns them
for neglecting to reckon those infinitely powerful but perhaps less
calculable forces.</p>

<p>But of all the productive forces of a nation none, according to
List, can equal manufactures, for manufactures develop the moral
forces of a nation to a superlative degree. “The spirit of striving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
for a steady increase in mental and bodily acquirements, of emulation
and of liberty, characterise a State devoted to manufactures and
commerce.… In a country devoted to mere raw agriculture, dullness
of mind, awkwardness of body, obstinate adherence to old
notions, customs, methods, and processes, want of culture, of
prosperity, and of liberty prevail.”<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Manufactures permit of a
better utilisation of a country’s products than is the case even with
agriculture. Its water-power, its winds, its minerals, and its fuel
supplies are better husbanded. The presence of manufactures gives
a powerful impetus to agriculture, for the agriculturist profits even
more than the manufacturer, owing to the high rent, increased
profits, and better wages that follow upon an increased demand for
agricultural products. The very proximity of manufactures constitutes
a kind of permanent market for those agricultural products,
a market which neither war nor hostile tariffs can ever affect. It
gives rise to varied demands and allows of a variation of cultivation,
which results in a regional division of labour. This enables each
district to develop along the most advantageous line, whereas in
a purely agricultural country each one has to produce for his personal
consumption, which means the absence of division of labour and a
consequent limitation of production.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>Industry for List is not what it was for Smith. For him it is
a social force, the creator of capital and of labour, and not the
natural result of labour and saving. It deserves introduction even
at the expense of a temporary loss, and its justification is that of
all liberal institutions, namely, the impetus given to future production.
In a beautiful comparison which would deserve a niche in a
book of classical economic quotations he writes as follows: “It is
true that experience teaches that the wind bears the seed from one
region to another, and that thus waste moorlands have been transformed
into dense forests; but would it on that account be wise
policy for the forester to wait until the wind in the course of ages
effects this transformation?”<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The tariff, apparently, is the only
method of raising the wind.</p>

<p>By placing himself at this point of view List is able to defeat
the most powerful arguments used by his opponents. All we
can say in reply is that manufactures will not produce these effects
if they have not already a <i>raison d’ètre</i> in the natural evolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of a nation—that is, if they do not demand too costly a sacrifice.
The land on which the settler sows his corn can scarcely be regarded
as ready to receive it if it lacks the power to make it
grow.</p>

<p>List’s Protectionism, as we may guess from what precedes,
possesses original features. It is not a universal remedy which may
be indifferently applied to every country at any period or to all its
products. It is a particular process which can only be used in certain
cases and under certain conditions. Subjoined are some of the characteristic
traits of this Protectionism which List himself has neatly
described.</p>

<p>(1) The Protectionist system can only be justified when it aims
at the industrial education of a nation.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> It is thus inapplicable to a
nation like the English, whose industrial education is already complete.
Nor should it be attempted by countries that have neither
the aptitude nor the resources necessary for an industrial career.
The nations of the tropical zone seem destined to the pursuit of
agriculture, while those of the temperate zone are accustomed to
engage in many and varied forms of production.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>(2) But a further justification is also necessary. It must be
shown that the nation’s progress is retarded by the competition of a
powerful manufacturing rival which has already advanced farther
on the industrial path.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> “The reason for this is the same as that
why a child or a boy in wrestling with a strong man can scarcely
be victorious or even offer steady resistance.”<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> This was precisely
the case with Germany in her struggle with England. (It is interesting
to come across a full account of the process of “dumping” in
List’s letters to Ingersoll. “Dumping,” which has received much
attention lately in connection with the trust movement, consists in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
selling at a low price in foreign markets in order to keep up prices
in the home market.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>)</p>

<p>(3) Even in that case Protection can be justified “only until that
manufacturing Power is strong enough no longer to have any reason to
fear foreign competition, and thenceforth only so far as may be necessary
for protecting the inland manufacturing power in its very roots.”<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>(4) Lastly, Protection ought never to be extended to agriculture.
The reasons for this exception are that on the one hand agricultural
prosperity depends to a great extent upon the progress of manufactures—the
protection of the latter indirectly benefits the former—and
on the other hand an increase in the price of raw materials
or of food would injure industry. Moreover, there exists a natural
division which is particularly advantageous to the system of cultivation
pursued by each country, a division dependent upon the natural
qualities of their soils, which Protection would tend to destroy. This
territorial division does not exist for manufactures, “for the pursuit
of which every nation in the temperate zone seems to have an equal
vocation.”<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>One might experience some difficulty in understanding the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
<i>volte-face</i> of List in favour of free exchange in agriculture did we
forget the particular situation in Germany, to which his thoughts
always returned. This is equally true of many other points in his
system. Germany was an exporter of corn and suffered from the
operation of the English Corn Laws. German agriculture needed
no protection, but suffered from want of markets, and List would
have been very happy to persuade England to abandon her Corn
Laws. Agricultural protection was only revived in Germany
towards the end of 1879, when the agriculturists thought they were
being threatened by foreign competition.</p>

<h4 id="heading36">II: SOURCES OF LIST’S INSPIRATION. HIS INFLUENCE
UPON SUBSEQUENT PROTECTIONIST DOCTRINES.</h4>

<p>The question of the origin of List’s Protectionist ideas has frequently
been raised. The works of the Frenchmen Dupin and
Chaptal undoubtedly gave him some material for reflection, but he
was really confirmed in his opposition to <i>laissez-faire</i> by the men
whom he met in America. While there he came into intimate contact
with the members of a society which had been founded at Philadelphia
for the encouragement of national industry. The founder of this
society was an American statesman named Hamilton, the author
of a celebrated report upon manufactures, who as far back as 1791
had advocated the establishment of Protection for the encouragement
of struggling American industries.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Hamilton’s argument, as List
fully recognised, bears a striking similarity to the thesis of the
<i>National System</i>.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> The Philadelphian society, which was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
presided over by Matthew Carey (the father of the economist of whom
we shall have to speak by and by), immediately after List’s arrival
in America inaugurated an active campaign on behalf of a revision
of the tariffs. Ingersoll, the vice-president, persuaded List to join
in the campaign, which he did by publishing in 1827 a number of
letters which caused quite a sensation.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> They are really just a
<i>résumé</i> of the <i>National System</i>. The policy which in the course of
a few years he was to advocate in Germany he now recommended
to the consideration of the Americans.</p>

<p>But facts were even more eloquent than books, and what chiefly
struck the practical mind and the observant eye of List was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
material success of American Protection, just as in Germany he
had been impressed by the beneficial effects which temporary Protection
enforced by the Continental Blockade had produced there.<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>Far from being injurious to the economic development of the
United States, it seemed as if Protection had really helped it. What
it actually did was to quicken by the space of a few years an evolution
which nature herself was one day bound to accomplish. So
vast was the territory, so abundant the natural resources, and so
advantageously were they placed for the application of human
energy that no system, however defective, could long have delayed
the accumulation of wealth. The similar condition of Germany
lent colour to the belief that the same experiment carried on under
similar circumstances would also succeed there.</p>

<p>Accordingly, List’s work, though not directly connected with
any known American system, is the first treatise which gives a clear
indication of the influence upon European thought of the economic
experiences of the New World.</p>

<p>In a beautiful paragraph in the <i>National System</i> List has himself
confessed to this. “When afterwards I visited the United States,
I cast all books aside—they would only have tended to mislead me.
The best work on political economy which one can read in that
modern land is actual life. There one may see wildernesses grow
into rich and mighty states; and progress which requires centuries
in Europe goes on there before one’s eyes, viz. that from the condition
of the mere hunter to the rearing of cattle, from that to agriculture,
and from the latter to manufactures and commerce. There one may
see how rents increase by degrees from nothing to important revenues.
There the simple peasant knows practically far better than the most
acute savants of the Old World how agriculture and rents can be
improved; he endeavours to attract manufacturers and artificers
to his vicinity. Nowhere so well as there can one learn the importance
of means of transport, and their effect on the mental and material
life of the people. That book of actual life I have earnestly and
diligently studied, and compared with the results of my previous
studies, experience, and reflections.”<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>Though from this point of view List’s Protectionism seems
closely connected with the most modern of economic units, a still
closer tie links him to the Mercantilism of old. Nor did he ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
dissemble his love for the Mercantilists, especially for Colbert.
He accused Smith and Say of having misunderstood them, and he
declared that they themselves more justly deserved the title of
Mercantilists because of their attempt to apply to whole nations a
very simple conception which they had merely copied from a merchant’s
note-book, namely, the advice to buy in the cheapest and
sell in the dearest market. He distinguishes between two classes of
Mercantilists according as they are influenced by one or other of
two dominating ideas. On the one hand we have those who
emphasise the importance of industrial education, which is the
dominant note in List’s philosophy. This idea has quite taken
the place of the older idea of a favourable balance of trade, and
has been adopted by such a Liberal thinker as John Stuart Mill,
whereas the other has been definitely rejected by the science.
Furthermore, the Mercantilism of the seventeenth century was
a special instrument employed in the interests of a permanent
policy, which was exclusively national; while List’s Protection,
according to his own opinion, was merely a means of leading nations
towards the possibility of union on a footing of equality. It was a
mere transitory system, a policy dictated by circumstances.</p>

<p>List’s system cannot be regarded as the inspirer of modern Protection,
any more than he himself can be regarded as a direct descendant
of the old Mercantilists. Even in Germany, despite the great
literary success of his work, its influence was practically <i>nil</i>, unless
we credit it with the slight increase of taxation upon which the
Zollverein decided in 1844, and couple with it the Protectionist
campaign afterwards carried on by List in the columns of his newspaper.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
But the Liberal reforms carried out by the English Parliament
under the Premiership of Peel were during that very same
year crowned by the abolition of the Corn Laws. This measure
caused much consternation throughout Europe, and the confirmation
which Cobden’s ideas thus received influenced public opinion
a good deal and gave a Liberal trend to the commercial policy of
Europe during the next few years. The <i>régime</i> of commercial treaties
inaugurated by Napoleon III was an outcome of this change of
feeling.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1879 a vague kind of Protectionism made its
appearance in Europe. Tariff walls were raised, but they never
seemed to be high enough. One would like to know whether these
new tariffs, established successfully by Germany and France, were
in any way inspired by List’s ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>It does not seem that they were. Neither of the two countries
which have remained faithful to a thoroughgoing Protection any
longer needs industrial education. Both of them have long since
arrived at that complex state which, according to List, is necessary
for the full development of their civilisation and the expansion
of their power. Germany and the United States have no longer
any cause to fear England. Their commercial fleets are numerous,
their warships powerful, and their empires are every day expanding.
Were he to return to this world to-day, List, who so energetically
emphasised the relative value of the various commercial systems, and
the necessity of adapting one’s method to the changing conditions of
the times and the character of the nation, but always laid such
stress upon the essentially temporary character of the tariffs raised,
would perhaps find himself ranged on the side of those who demand a
lowering of those barriers in the interest of a more liberal expansion
of productive forces. Has he himself not declared that “in a few
years the civilised nations of the world, through the perfection of
the means of transport, through the influence of material and intellectual
ties, will be as united, nay, even more closely knit together,
than were the counties of England a hundred years ago”?<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Even
the profound changes in the international economic situation during
the last sixty years fail to supply a serious justification for the Protectionist
policy of the great commercial nations, and the essential
traits of this new <i>régime</i> differ <i>toto cælo</i> from the outlines supplied
by List. Far from allowing agriculture to develop naturally, there
has arisen the cry for some protection for the farmer, which has
served as a pretext for a general reinforcement of tariffs in a great
number of cases, notably in France and Germany. The competition
of American corn has hindered European agriculture from benefiting
by the advancement of industry as List had predicted. Modern
tariffs, involving as they do the taxation of both agricultural and
industrial products, imply a conception of Protection entirely different
from List’s. He would have confined Protection to the most important
branches of national production—to those industries from
which the other and secondary branches receive their supplies. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
on this ground would he have justified exceptional treatment.<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> It is
an essentially vigorous conception, and what he sought of Protection
was an energetic stimulant and an agent of progress. But a tariff
which indifferently protects every enterprise, which no longer distinguishes
between the fertilising and the fertilised industries, and
increases all prices at the same time, can have only one effect—a loss
for one producer and a gain for another. Their relative positions
remain intact. It is no longer a means of stimulating productive
energy; it is merely a general instrument of defence against foreign
competition, and is essentially conservative and timorous.</p>

<p>To speak the truth, tariff duties are never of the nature of an
application of economic doctrines. They are the results of a compromise
between powerful interests which often enough have nothing
in common with the general interest, but are determined by purely
political, financial, or electoral considerations. Hence it is futile to
hope for a trace of List’s doctrines in the Protective tariffs actually
in operation. His influence, if indeed it is perceptible anywhere,
must be sought amid the subsidiary doctrines which uphold them.</p>

<p>The only complete exposition of Protectionism that has been
given us since List’s is that of Carey,<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> the American economist.
Carey was at first a Free Trader, but in 1858 became a Protectionist,
and his ideas, which were expounded in his great work <i>The Principles
of Social Science</i>, published in 1858-59, bear a striking resemblance
to those of his German predecessor.</p>

<p>Carey, like List, directs his attack against the industrial pre-eminence
of England, and substitutes for the ideal of international
division of labour the ideal of independent nationality, each nation
devoting itself to all branches of economic activity, and thus evolving
its own individuality. According to him, Free Trade tends to
“establish one single factory for the whole world, whither all the
raw produce has to be sent whatever be the cost of transport.”<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
The effect of this system is to hinder or retard the progress of all
nations for the sake of this one. But a society waxes wealthy and
strong only in proportion as it helps in the development of a number
of productive associations wherein various kinds of employments
are being pursued, which increase the demand for mutual services
and aid one another by their very proximity. Such associations
alone are capable of developing the latent faculties of man<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> and of
increasing his hold upon nature. These two traits help to define
economic progress. Under a slightly different form we have a
picture of the normal nation or the complex State so dear to the
heart of Friedrich List—an ideal of continuous progress as the
object of commercial policy being substituted for one of immediate
enrichment.</p>

<p>Following List, but in a still more detailed fashion, Carey sought
to show the beneficial effects that the proximity of protected industry
would have upon agriculture. But unfortunately there are
other arguments upon which Carey lays equal stress that are really
of a much more debatable character.</p>

<p>Protection, according to Carey, by furnishing a ready market for
agricultural products, would free agriculture from the burden of an
exorbitant cost of carriage to a distant place. This argument, which
List<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> merely threw out as a passing suggestion, continually recurs
with the American author. But, as Stuart Mill justly remarked,<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
if America consents to such expenditure it affords a proof that she
procures by means of international exchange more manufactured
goods than if she manufactured them herself.</p>

<p>Another no less debatable point: The exportation of agricultural
products, says Carey, exhausts the soil, for the products being consumed
away from the spot where they are grown, the fertilizing
agents which they contain are not restored to the earth; a manufacturing
population in the immediate neighbourhood<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> would
remedy this. But, as John Stuart Mill again remarks,<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> and justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
enough, it is not Free Trade that forces America to export cereals.
If she does so, it is because exhaustion of soil appears to her an
insignificant inconvenience compared with the advantage gained by
exportation.</p>

<p>Carey, finally, was one of the first to discover in Protection a
means of increasing wages. Once the complex economic State is
established there arises a keen competition between the <i>entrepreneurs</i>
who require the service of labour—a competition which naturally
benefits the workman. But this advantage, granting that it does
exist, is more than counterbalanced by the increased price of
goods.</p>

<p>We see that Carey, although sharing the fundamental conceptions
of List, employs arguments that are much less valid. Both in
power of exposition and in the scientific value of his work, the German
author shows himself vastly superior to his American successor.
He is also much more moderate. Carey is not content with industrial
Protection; he demands agricultural Protection as well, and the
duties, though a little higher than those proposed by List, seem
hardly sufficient for him.</p>

<p>Despite all this similarity of views, Carey does not owe his
inspiration to List. He was acquainted with the <i>National System</i>
and he quoted it. But American economic literature had already
supplied him with analogous suggestions. Even more than books,
the economic life of America itself as it evolved before his very
eyes had contributed to the formation of his ideas. It was the
progress of America under a Protective <i>régime</i>, it was the spectacle
of a country as yet entirely new and sparsely populated, increasing
the produce of her soil as colonisation extended, and multiplying her
wealth as population became more dense, that inspired him with the
idea of a policy of isolation with a view to hastening the utilisation
of those enormous resources. More fortunate than List, he saw his
ideas accepted, if not by the scientific experts of his country (who
on the whole remained aloof), at least by the American politician,
who has applied his principles rather freely.<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>Carey’s doctrine, accordingly, cannot be attributed directly to
the influence of List. It remains to be seen whether List had any
influence upon European doctrines.</p>

<p>He undoubtedly succeeded in forcing the acceptance of the idea
of a temporary Protection for infant industries even upon Free
Traders. The most notable convert to this view was John Stuart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Mill.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> But it was a somewhat Platonic concession that he made. He
thought it inapplicable to old countries, for their education was no
longer incomplete, and at best useful only for new countries.</p>

<p>Can modern Protectionists claim descent from List? In the
absence of any systematic treatise dealing with their ideas, it is not
always easy to glean the significance of their doctrines from the
various articles, discourses, and brochures amid which they are
scattered.<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Neglecting those writers who are merely content to
reproduce the old fallacies of the Mercantile arguments concerning
the balance of trade,<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> the majority of them appear to base their case
more or less explicitly upon two principal arguments: (1) the
necessity for economic autonomy; (2) the patriotic necessity of
securing a national market for national products.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> These two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
points of view, which are more or less clearly avowed and accepted
as political maxims, would, if applied with logical strictness,
result in making all external commerce useless. Each nation would
thus be reduced to using just those resources with which Nature
had happened to endow it, but it could get little if any of the goods
produced by the rest of mankind. These two ideas were not
absolutely foreign to List’s thought, although they never assumed
anything more than a secondary or subordinate character. He never
considered them as the permanent supports of a commercial policy.</p>

<p>List frequently spoke of making a nation independent of foreign
markets by means of industry. He considered that nation highest
which “has cultivated manufacturing industry in all its branches
within its territory to the highest perfection, and whose territory
and agricultural production is large enough to supply its manufacturing
population with the largest part of the necessaries of life
and raw materials which they require.” But he also recognised that
such advantages were exceptional, and that it would be folly for a
nation to attempt to supply itself by means of national division
of labour—that is, by home production—with articles for the production
of which it is not favoured by nature, and which it can
procure better and cheaper by means of international division of
labour, or, in other words, through foreign commerce. Complete
autonomy is accordingly an illusion. But we cannot deny that
some of his expressions seem to give credit to the false idea that a
country which obtains a considerable portion of its consumption
goods from foreigners must be dependent upon those foreigners.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
In fact, it is no more dependent upon the foreigner than the foreigner
is upon it. In the case of a buyer and seller who is the dependent
person? There is but one instance in which the expression is justified,
and that is when a foreign country has become the only source of
supply for certain commodities. Then the buyer does become
dependent, and List rightly enough had in view the manufacturing
monopoly enjoyed by England—a monopoly that no longer exists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>He also spoke of retaining the home market for home-made
goods; but he thought that this guarantee would of necessity have
to be limited to the period when a nation is seeking to create an
industry for itself: at a later period foreign competition becomes
desirable in order to keep manufacturers and workmen from indolence
and indifference.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>At no period was List anxious to make economic autonomy or
the preservation of the home market the pivot of his commercial
policy. The creation of native industry is the only justification of
protective rights, but this is the one point which modern Protectionists
cannot insist upon without anachronism.</p>

<p>List left no marked traces of his influence either upon practical
politics or upon Protectionist doctrines. It is in his general views
that we must seek the source of his influence and the reason for the
position which he holds in the history of economic doctrines.</p>

<h4 id="heading37">III: LIST’S REAL ORIGINALITY</h4>

<p>List’s method is essentially that of the pioneer. He was the first
to make systematic use of historical comparison as a means of
demonstration in political economy. Although he can lay no claim
to be the founder of the method, still the brilliant use which he
made of it justifies us in classifying him as the equal, if not the
superior, of those who at the same moment were attempting the
creation of the Historical school and the transformation of history
into the essential organon of economic research.</p>

<p>List also introduced new and useful points of view into economics.
The principle of free exchange as formulated by Smith, and especially
by Ricardo and Say, was evidently too absolute and rested upon a
demonstration that was too abstract for the ordinary politician. If,
as List justly remarks, the practice of commercial nations has so
long remained contrary to a doctrine that all economists regard as
admirable, it is not without some just cause. As a matter of fact, can
the statesman ever place himself outside of the point of view of
national interest of which he is the custodian? It is not enough for
him to know that the interchange of products will in some degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
increase wealth.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> He must be certain that this increased wealth
will benefit his own nation. He must be equally well assured that
Free Trade will not result in too sudden a displacement of population
or industry, the social and political results of which might be very
harmful. In other words, political economy must be subordinated
to politics in general, and to-day there is no single economist who
does not recognise the impossibility of separating them in practice.<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
There is none that does not perceive the influence of political power
on economic prosperity, and that consequently does not recognise the
necessity for the different complexion which the peculiar circumstances
of each country imposes upon the practical application of
the principle of commercial liberty.</p>

<p>This is not all. List by abandoning the favourite habit of
eighteenth-century writers who contrasted man and society, and by
giving us a picture of man as he really is, as a member of a nation,
has introduced a fruitful conception into economics of which we
have not yet seen the full results. He rightly treats of nations not
merely as moral and political associations created by history, but
also as economic associations. Just as a nation is politically
strengthened by the moral cohesion of its citizens, so its economic
cohesion increases the productive energy of each individual and
enhances the prosperity of the whole nation.</p>

<p>And Governments, while charged with maintaining the political
unity of a country, ought also to retain its economic unity by subordinating
all local interests to the general interest, by preserving
intact the liberty of internal trade, by organising railways and canals
on a national basis, by keeping watch over the central bank, and by
aiming at a uniform code of commercial legislation. This was the
programme outlined by List in his paper the <i>Zollvereinsblatt</i>.</p>

<p>This belief in the power which a unified economic organisation
can bring to a nation is by no means too common among individualists,
who at bottom are often particularists. But List possessed it in
the highest degree. He devoted many years of his life to advocating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the establishment of a German railway system, and it was he who
traced the principal highways which have since been established
in Germany. Protection, in his opinion, was one means of increasing
the economic cohesion of Germany, because of the solidarity of
interests which would result from the presence of a powerful industry.</p>

<p>With similar enthusiasm he devoted himself to two apparently
contradictory tasks—the suppression of inter-State duties and the
establishment of protective rights. To him there was no element
of contradiction in this, any more than there would be for us in a
national system of political economy with no protective rights.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>He also extended the political horizon of the Classical school and
substituted a dynamic for their purely static conception of national
development. His thorough examination of the conditions of
economic progress is a contribution to the study of international
trade exactly analogous to the contribution made by Sismondi to
the study of national welfare. But, unlike Sismondi, who wished to
retard this progress, he is anxious to stimulate it, and so he charges
the State with the duty of safeguarding the future prosperity of the
country and with furthering its production. The actual procedure,
involving as it did the establishment of protective rights, may
appear to us to be unfortunate.<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> But the idea which inspires it—the
recognition that in the interests of the future national power has a
definitely economic <i>rôle</i>—is essentially sound. To-day it is a mere
commonplace, but when List enunciated it it was quite a novel
idea.</p>

<p>In attempting to define List’s real significance one feels that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
he failed in the achievement of his chief aim. He has not succeeded
in breaking down the abstract theory of international trade. On
the other hand, he did make a real contribution to economic science,
a contribution which the whole of the nineteenth century seemed
bent upon emphasising, namely, that the Classical writers had been
too ready to draw universal conclusions from their doctrines, forgetting
that in economics it is never safe to pass from pure theory to
practical applications without taking account of the intermediate
links and making allowance for change of time and place—considerations
which abstract theory rightly avoids. List’s merit lies in his
having emphasised this truth, especially in the region of international
trade, and in his doing it just at that particular moment.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V_PROUDHON_AND_THE">CHAPTER V: PROUDHON AND THE
SOCIALISM OF 1848</h3>

<p>Proudhon comes next, though his place in the history of economic
doctrines is not easily defined. Like all socialists he begins with a
criticism of the rights of property. The economists had carefully
avoided discussing them, and political economy had become a mere
<i>résumé</i> of the results of private property. Proudhon regarded these
rights as the very basis of the present social system and the real
cause of every injustice. Accordingly he starts with a criticism of
property in opposition to the economists who defended it.</p>

<p>But how can we reform the present system or replace it by a
better? Herein lies the difficulty. Born twenty years earlier,
Proudhon, like many others, would perhaps have invented a Utopia.
But what was possible in 1820 was no longer so twenty years later.
Public opinion was already satiated with schemes of reform. Owen,
Saint-Simon, Fourier, Cabet, and Louis Blanc had each in his turn
proposed a remedy. The fancy of reformers had roamed at will
over the whole wide expanse of possible reforms. Proudhon was
well acquainted with all these efforts, and had come to the conclusion
that they were all equally useless. Hence he turns out to be a critic
of the socialists as well as of the economists.</p>

<p>Proudhon attempts the correction of the vices of private property
without becoming a party to what he calls the “crass stupidity of
socialism.” Every Utopian scheme is instinctively rejected. He
cares nothing for those who view society as they do machinery and
think that an ingenious trick is all that is needed to correct all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
anomalies and to reset the machine in motion. To him social life
means perpetual progress.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> He knows that time is required for the
conciliation of those social forces that are warring against one another.
He was engrossed with his attempt to find a solution for this difficult
problem when the Revolution of 1848 broke out, and Proudhon,
suddenly thrown into action, finds himself forced to express his
ideas in a concrete form, such that all could understand. The critic
has to try his hand at construction, and almost despite himself he
outlines another Utopia in his Exchange Bank.</p>

<p>Other writers had sought a solution in the complete overthrow of
the present methods of production and distribution. But Proudhon
thought it lay in improved circulation. It was an ingenious idea, and
it deserves mention in a history of economic doctrines because of
the truth, mingled with error, which it contains, and because it
has become the type of a series of similar projects. It is upon this
conception that we wish to dilate here. Leaving aside his other
ideas, which are no whit less interesting, we shall treat of Proudhon
the philosopher, moralist, and political theorist only in so far as these
have influenced Proudhon the economist.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading38">I: CRITICISM OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND SOCIALISM</h4>

<p>The work that first brought Proudhon to the notice of the public
was a book published in 1840 entitled <i>Qu’est-ce que la Propriété?</i>
Proudhon was then thirty-one years of age.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Born at Besançon, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
was the son of a brewer,<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> and was forced to earn his living at an early
age. He first became a proof-corrector, and then set up as a printer
on his own account. Despite hard work he became a diligent reader,
his only guide being his insatiable thirst for knowledge. The sight
of social injustice had sent the iron into his soul. Economic questions
were faced with all the ardour of youth, with all the enthusiasm of
a man of the people speaking on behalf of his brothers, and with all
the confidence of one who believes in the convincing force of logic
and common sense. All this is very evident in his brilliantly imaginative
work. Mingled with it is a good deal of that provoking swagger
which was noted by Sainte-Beuve as one of his characteristics, and
which appears in all his writings.</p>

<p>Throughout this treatise from first page to last there periodically
flashes one telling phrase which sums up his whole argument,
“Property is theft.”<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The question then arises as to whether Proudhon regards all
property as theft. Does he condemn appropriation, or is it the mere
fact of possession that he is inveighing against? This is how the
public at large have viewed it, and it would be useless to deny that
Proudhon owes a great deal to this interpretation, and the consequent
consternation of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. But his meaning is quite different.
Private property in the sense of the free disposal of the fruits of
labour and saving is in his opinion of the very essence of liberty. At
bottom this is nothing more than man’s control over himself.<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> But
why attack property, then? Property is attacked because it gives
to the proprietor a right to an income for which he has not worked.
It is not property as such, but the right of escheat, that forms the
butt of Proudhon’s attack; and following the lead of Owen and other
English socialists, as well as the Saint-Simonians, he directs his charges
against that right of escheat which, according to circumstances and
the character of the revenue, is variously known as rent, discount,
money interest, agricultural privilege, sinecure, etc.<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>Like every socialist, Proudhon considered that labour alone was
productive.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Land and capital without labour were useless. Hence
the demand of the proprietor for a share of the produce as a return
for the service which his capital has yielded is radically false. It
is based upon the supposition that capital by itself is productive,
whereas the capitalist in taking payment for it literally receives
something for nothing.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is simply theft. His own definition of property is, “The
right to enjoy the fruits of industry, or of the labour of others, or to
dispose of those fruits to others by will.”<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>The theme is not new, and the line of thought will be resumed—by
Rodbertus among others. The originality of the work
consists not so much in the idea as in the brilliance of the exposition,
the vehemence of the style, and the verve of the polemics hurled
against the old arguments which based property upon labour, upon
natural right, or upon occupation. A German writer<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> has said that,
published in Germany or in England, the book would have passed
unnoticed, because in both those countries the defence of property
had been much more scientific than in France.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>The whole force of the work lies, not in itself, but in the weakness
of the opposing arguments, and this fact is quite sufficient to give it
a certain permanent value. The treatise sent an echo through the
whole world, and its author may be said to have done for French
socialism what Lassalle did for German. The ideas set forth are not
new, but they are expressed in phrases of wonderful penetration.</p>

<p>There is also a wealth of ingenious remarks, which, if not,
perhaps, true, deserve retention because of their originality. How
such spoliation on the part of capitalists and proprietors can continue
without a revolt of the working men is a question which has been
asked by every writer on theoretical socialism, without its full import
ever being realised. Is there not something very improbable in this?
The problem is a curious one, indeed, and requires much ingenuity
for its solution. Marx disposed of it by his theory of surplus value.
Rodbertus in a simpler fashion showed the opposition between
economic distribution as realised in exchange and the social distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
which lurks behind it. Proudhon has his own solution. There
is, says he, between master and men continual miscalculation.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
The master pays each workman in proportion to the value of his
own individual labour, but reserves for himself the product which
results from the collective force of all—a product which is altogether
superior to that yielded by the sum of their individual efforts. This
excessive product represents profits. “It is said that the capitalist
pays his workmen by the day. But to be more exact we ought to
say that he pays a <i>per diem</i> wage multiplied by the number of
workmen employed each day—which is not the same thing. For
that immense force which results from union and from the harmonious
combination of simultaneous efforts he has paid nothing. Two
hundred grenadiers can deck the base of the Louqsor statue in a few
hours, a task which would be quite impossible for one man though
he worked two hundred days. According to the capitalist reckoning
the wages paid in both cases would be the same.”<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> “And so the
worker is led to believe that he is paid for his work, whereas in
reality he is only partly paid for it. Even after receiving his wage
he still retains a right of property in the things which he has produced.”<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
His explanation, though very subtle, is none the less
erroneous.</p>

<p>The appearance of the pamphlet made Proudhon famous, not
merely in the eyes of the public, who knew little of him beyond his
famous formula, but also in the opinion of the economists. Blanqui
and Garnier, among others, interested themselves in his work. “It
is impossible to have a higher opinion of anyone than I have of
you,” writes the former.<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Blanqui by his favourable report to the
Academy of Moral Sciences was instrumental in thwarting the
legal proceedings which the Minister of the Interior was anxious
to take against Proudhon. And it was upon Garnier’s advice that
the publisher Guillaumin, although a strong adherent of orthodox
economics, consented to issue a new work by Proudhon in 1846.
The book was entitled <i>Les Contradictions économiques</i>, and Guillaumin
was not a little startled by it.<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The sympathy of the economists is easily explained. They
realised from the first that Proudhon was a vigorous opponent of
their views, but it was not long before they discovered that he
was an equally resolute critic of socialism. Let us briefly examine
his attitude with regard to the latter.</p>

<p>No one has ever referred to socialists in harsher terms. “The
Saint-Simonians have vanished like a masquerade.”<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> “Fourier’s
system is the greatest mystification of our time.”<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> To the communists
he writes as follows: “Hence, communists! Your presence
is a stench in my nostrils and the sight of you disgusts me.” Elsewhere
he says: “Socialism is a mere nothing. It never has been
and never will be anything.”<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> The violence of his attitude towards
his predecessors springs from a fear of being confused with them.
The procedure is intended to put the reader on his guard against
all equivocation, and to afford him valuable preparation for appreciating
Proudhon’s solutions by showing how utterly impossible the
other solutions are.</p>

<p>His attack upon the socialists roughly amounts to a charge of
failure to realise that the destruction of the present <i>régime</i> would
involve taking a course in the opposite direction. The difficult
problem which he set out to solve was not merely the suppression of
existing economic forces, but also their equilibration.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> He never
contemplated “the extinction of such economic forces as division
of labour, collective effort, competition, credit, property, or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
economic liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> His chief concern was to preserve them, but
at the same time to suppress the conflict that exists between
them. The socialists aim merely at destruction. For competition
they would substitute an associative organisation of
labour; instead of private property they would set up community
of goods<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> or collectivism; instead of the free play of personal
interest they would, according to Fourier, substitute love, or love
and devotion, as the Saint-Simonians put it, or the fraternity of
Cabet. But none of these satisfies Proudhon.</p>

<p>He dismisses association and organisation as being detrimental
to the liberty of the worker.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Labour’s power is just the result of
“collective force and division of labour.” Liberty is the economic
force <i>par excellence</i>. “Economic perfection lies in the absolute
independence of the workers, just as political perfection consists in
the absolute independence of the citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> “Liberty,” he remarks
in an address delivered to the electors of the department of the Seine
in 1848, “is the sum total of my system—liberty of conscience,
freedom of the press, freedom of labour, of commerce, and of teaching,
the free disposal of the products of labour and industry—liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
infinite, absolute, everywhere and for ever.” He adds that his is
“the system of ’89,” and that he is preaching the doctrines of
Quesnay, of Turgot, and of Say. Indeed, it would not be difficult
to imagine ourselves reading the Classical rhapsodies concerning the
advantages of Free Trade over again.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>Communism as a juridical system is rejected no less energetically.
There is no suggestion of suppressing private property,
which is the necessary stimulant of labour, the basis of family
life, and indispensable to all true progress. His chief concern
is to make it harmless and to place it at the disposal of everyone.<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
“Communism is merely an inverted form of private property.
Communism gives rise to inequalities, but of a different character
from those of property. Property is the exploitation of the weak by
the strong, communism of the strong by the weak.”<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> It is still
robbery. “Communism,” he exclaims, “is the religion of misery.”<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
“Between the institution of private property and communism there
is a world of difference.”<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>Racial devotion or fraternity as possible motives for action are
not recognised. They imply the sacrifice and the subordination of
one man to another. All men have equal rights, and the freer
exercise of those rights is a matter of justice, not of fraternity.
Proudhon thinks the axiom so very evident that he takes no trouble
to explain it, but merely gives us a definition of justice. In his first
<i>Mémoire</i> it is defined as “a kind of respect spontaneously felt and
reciprocally guaranteed to human dignity in any person and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
all circumstances, even though the discharge of that feeling exposes
us to some risk.”<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

<p>His justice is tantamount to equality. If we apply the definition
to the economic links which bind men together, we find that the
principle of mutual respect is transformed into the principle of
reciprocal service.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> Men must be made to realise this need for reciprocal
service. It is the only way in which equality can be respected.
“Do unto others as you would that others do unto you”—this
principle of justice is the ethical counterpart of the economic
precept of mutual service.<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> Reciprocal service must be the new
principle which must guide us in rearranging the economic links of
society.</p>

<p>And so a criticism of socialism helps Proudhon to define the
positive basis of his own system. The terms of the social problem
as it presents itself to him can now be clearly followed. On the one
hand there is the suppression of the unearned income derived from
property—a revenue which is in direct opposition to the principle
of reciprocal service. On the other hand, property itself must be
preserved, liberty of work and right of exchange must be secured.
In other words, the fundamental attribute of property must be
removed without damaging the institution of property itself or
endangering the principle of liberty.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>It is the old problem of how to square the circle. The extinction
of unearned incomes must involve the communal ownership of the
instruments of production, although Proudhon did not seem to think
so. Hitherto the reform of property had been attempted by attacking
the production and distribution of wealth. No attention was
ever paid to exchange. But Proudhon thought that in the act of
exchange inequality creeps in and a new method of exchange is
needed. Towards the end of the <i>Contradictions économiques</i>
he gives us an obscure hint of the kind of reform to be aimed at.
After declaring that nothing now remains to be done except “to
sum up all contradictions in one general equation,” he proceeds to
ask what particular form that equation is to take. We have already,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
he remarks, been permitted a glimpse of it. “It must be a law
of exchange based upon a theory of mutual help. This theory of
mutualism—that is, of natural exchange—is from the collective
point of view a synthesis of two ideas—that of property and that of
communism.”<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> No further definition is attempted. In a letter
written after the publication of the <i>Contradictions</i> he still refers to
himself as a simple seeker, and states that he has a new book in
preparation, in which these propositions are to be further developed.</p>

<p>About the same time he had laid out his plans for active propaganda
in the press. But the Revolution of 1848 threw him into the
<i>mêlée</i> of party politics and hastened the publication of his theories.</p>

<p>In order to give a better idea of the place occupied by Proudhon’s
ideas, and to show how they were connected with the socialist
experiments of the time, we must say a few words about the Revolution
itself.</p>

<h4 id="heading39">II: THE REVOLUTION OF 1848 AND THE DISCREDIT
OF SOCIALISM</h4>

<p>Socialists of all shades of opinion, who from 1830 to 1840 had been
advocating radical reforms, were given a unique opportunity of
putting their theories to the test during the Revolution of 1848.
During the four months (February to June) which preceded the
terrible ruin of the socialist Republic by the <i>bourgeoisie</i> projects of
all kinds which for many years had been discussed in books and
newspapers appeared to be on the point of bearing fruit. For a
number of weeks nothing seemed impossible. “The right to work,”
“organisation of labour,” and “association,” instead of being so
many formulas, were by a mere stroke of the magic wand to be
translated into realities.</p>

<p>Enthusiasts were not wanting to attempt this task of transformation,
but, alas! only to find every scheme tumble into ruins.
Every formula, when put to the test, was found to be void. The
malevolence of some people, the impatience of others, the awkwardness
and haste of the promoters even, made the experiments odious
and ridiculous. Public opinion was at last thoroughly wearied and
all the reformers were indiscriminately condemned.</p>

<p>The year 1848 is accordingly a memorable one in the history of
social ideas. The idealistic socialism of Louis Blanc, of Fourier, and
of Saint-Simon was definitely discredited. <i>Bourgeois</i> writers thought
that it was utterly destroyed. Reybaud, who contributed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
article on Socialism to the <i>Dictionnaire d’Économie politique</i> (edited
by Coquelin and Guillaumin) in 1852, writes as follows: “To speak
of socialism nowadays is to deliver a funeral oration. It has
exhausted itself. The vein is worked out. Should the human
mind in its vertigo ever take it up again it will be in a different form
and under the influence of other illusions.”</p>

<p>It fared scarcely better at the hands of subsequent socialists. Marx
referred to all his predecessors under the rather misleading title of
Utopians, and against their fantastic dreams he set up the “scientific
socialism” of <i>Das Kapital</i>. Between the two epochs lies a distinct
cleavage, marked by the Revolution of 1848. We must briefly see
how this was brought about, and rapidly review the more important
experiments that were made.</p>

<p>First of all there is “the right to work.” Fourier’s formula,
which was developed by Considérant and adopted by Louis Blanc
and other democrats, became extremely popular during the reign
of Louis Phillipe. Proudhon speaks of it as the only true formula
of the February Revolution. “Give me the right to work,” he
declares, “and I will give you the right of property.”<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<p>Workmen thought that the first duty of the Provisional Government
was to give effect to this formula. On February 25 a
small group of Parisian workmen came to the Hôtel de Ville to
urge their claims, and the Government hastened to recognise them.
The decree drawn up by Louis Blanc was as follows: “The Provisional
Government of the French Republic undertakes to guarantee
the existence of every worker by means of his labour. It further
undertakes to give work to all its citizens.” The following day
another decree announced the immediate establishment of national
workshops with a view to putting the new principle into practice.
All that was necessary to gain admission was to have one’s name
inscribed in one of the Parisian municipal offices.</p>

<p>Louis Blanc in his book of 1841 had demanded the establishment
of “social” workshops. Public opinion, misled by the similarity of
names, and encouraged to persist in its error by the enemies of
socialism, thought that the national workshops were the creation
of Louis Blanc. Nothing could be more incorrect. The “social”
workshops, as we know, were to engage in co-operative production,
whereas the national workshops were to provide employment for
idlers. Similar institutions had been established during every crisis
between 1790 and 1830, generally under the name of “charity works.”
Moreover, it was Marie, the Minister of Public Works, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Louis Blanc, who organised them. Far from providing work as the
socialists had hoped, the Government soon realised that the workshops
afforded an admirable opportunity for binding the workmen
together into brigades which might act as a check upon the socialistic
tendencies of the Luxembourg Commission, then presided over by
Louis Blanc. The workshops were placed under the management
of Émile Thomas, the engineer, who was an avowed opponent of
the scheme. In his <i>Histoire des Ateliers nationaux</i>, written in 1849,
he tells us how they were controlled by him in accordance with the
wishes of the anti-socialist majority of the Provisional Government.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>But they were mistaken in their calculations. Those who
thought that the national workshops could be used for their own
political ends were soon undeceived. The Revolution greatly increased
the number of idlers, already fairly considerable as the result of the
economic crisis of 1847. Moreover, the opening of the workshops
brought the workmen from the provinces into Paris. Instead of the
estimated 10,000, 21,000 had been enrolled by the end of March,
and by the end of April there were 99,400. They were paid two
francs a day while at work, and a franc when there was no work
for them. In a very short time it became impossible to find employment
for so many. The majority of them, whatever their trade,
were employed upon useless earthworks, and even these soon proved
inadequate. Discontent soon became rife among this army of unfortunate
workers, humiliated by the nature of the ridiculous labour
upon which they were employed, and scarcely satisfied with the
moderate salary which they received. The wages paid, however, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
more than enough for the kind of work that was being done. The
workshops became centres of political agitation, and the Government,
thoroughly alarmed, and acting under pressure from the National
Assembly, was constrained to abandon them.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on June 21, a summons was executed upon all men
between seventeen and twenty-five enrolled in the shops, ordering
them to join the army or to leave for the country, where more digging
awaited them. The exasperated workmen rose in revolt. Rioting
broke out on June 23, but it was crushed in three days. Hundreds
of the workers died in the struggle, and the country was terrorised
into reaction.</p>

<p>That simple logic which is always so characteristic of political
parties held the principle of “the right to work” responsible for this
disastrous experience, and it was definitely condemned. This is
quite clear from the constitutional debates in the National Assembly.
The constitutional plan laid down by Armand Marrast on June 19,
a few days before the riots, recognised “the right to work.” “The
Constitution,” says Article 2, “guarantees to every citizen liberty,
equality, security, instruction, work, property, and public assistance.”
But in the new plan of August 29—after the experience of
June—the article disappeared. The right to relief only was recognised.
In the discussion on the article an amendment re-establishing
“the right to work” was proposed by Mathieu de la Drôme. A
memorable debate followed, in which Thiers, Lamartine, and Tocqueville
opposed the amendment, while the Radical Republicans Ledru-Rollin,
Crémieux, and Mathieu de la Drôme defended it.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> The
socialists had become extinct. Louis Blanc was in exile, Considérant
ill, while Proudhon was afraid of startling his opponents and of
compromising his friends. Besides, the Assembly had already made
up its mind. The amendment was defeated, and Article 8 of the
preamble to the Constitution of 1848 runs as follows: “The
Republic by means of friendly assistance should provide for its
necessitous citizens, either by giving them work as far as it can,
or by directly assisting those who are unable to work and have no
one to help them.”</p>

<p>During the reign of the July Monarchy “the organisation of
labour” was another phrase which divided the honours with “the
right to work.” With the spread of the Revolution came a similar
menacing demand for its realisation. By a strange coincidence the
author of this formula was also a member of the Provisional Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
And so when on February 28, three days after the recognition
of “the right to work,” the workers came in a body and claimed the
creation of a Minister of Progress, the organisation of labour, and
the abolition of all exploitation, Louis Blanc immediately seized the
opportunity to urge his unwilling colleagues to accede to their
demands. He himself had pressed the Government to take the
initiative in social reform, and now that the Revolution had made
him a member of the Government how could he escape his responsibility?
After some difficulty his colleagues succeeded in persuading
him to accept the alternative of a Government commission on labour,
of which he was to be president. The commission was entrusted
with the task of drawing up the proposed reforms, which were afterwards
to be submitted to the National Assembly. To mark the
contrast between the old and the new <i>régime</i> the commission carried
on its deliberations in the Palais du Luxembourg, where the Chambre
des Paris formerly sat.</p>

<p>The Luxembourg commission was composed of representatives
elected by workmen and masters, three for each industry. The
representatives met in a general assembly to discuss the reports
prepared by a permanent committee of ten workers and an equal
number of masters, to which Louis Blanc had added a few Liberal
economists and socialists, such as Le Play, Dupont-White, Wolowski,
Considérant, Pecqueur, and Vidal. Proudhon was also invited, but
refused to join. As a matter of fact, only the workers took part in
the sittings.</p>

<p>The commission, although it possessed no executive power,
might have been of some service. But Louis Blanc, as he himself
confessed, regarded it as “a golden opportunity where socialism had
at its disposal a tribunal from which it could address the whole of
Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> He still kept up his <i>rôle</i> of orator and writer, and
devoted most of the sittings to an eloquent appeal for the theories
already outlined in his <i>Organisation of Labour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Vidal and Pecqueur
undertook the task of elaborating the more definite proposals. In a
lengthy report which appeared in the <i>Moniteur</i><a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> they outlined a
plan of State Socialism, with workshops and agricultural colonies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
with State depots and bazaars as places of sale. Money in the form
of warrants was to be borrowed on the security of goods, and a
State system of insurance—excepting life policies—was to be
established. Finally, the Bank of France was to be transformed
into a State bank. This was to extend the operation of credit,
and to reduce the rate of discount simply to insurance against
risk. Vidal and not Pecqueur is obviously the author of the report,
for it contains some of the projects that had already appeared in
his book <i>De la Répartition des Richesses</i>.</p>

<p>None of the projects was even discussed by the National
Assembly. The only positive piece of work accomplished by Louis
Blanc’s commission was done under pressure from the workmen.
This was the famous decree of March 2, abolishing piece-work
and reducing the working day to ten hours in Paris and eleven hours
in the provinces. This decree, though it was never put into
operation, marks the first rudiments of French labour legislation.
Louis Blanc was forced to grant it because the working-class element
on the commission refused to take part in its proceedings until they
were satisfied on this point. The commission must also be credited
with several successful attempts at conciliation.</p>

<p>Not only did the commission fail to do anything permanent,
but its degeneracy into a mere political club thoroughly alarmed
the public. It became involved in elections, and even intervened
in street riots. It finally took a part in the demonstration of
May 15, which, under pretext of demanding intervention in
favour of Poland, resulted in an invasion of the National Assembly
by the mob. Louis Blanc had already retired. Since the reunion
of the National Assembly the Government had been replaced by an
executive commission, and Blanc, no longer a supporter of the
Government, sent in his resignation on May 13. After that the
commission was at an end, and, like the national workshops,
it all resulted in nothing save a general discredit of socialist
opinion.</p>

<p>There still remained the “working men’s associations.” Every
socialist writer of the early nineteenth century was agreed on this
principle of association. Every reformer, with the exception of
Proudhon,<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> who always pursued a path of his own, regarded it as
the one method of emancipation. It was quite natural that it should
be put to the test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>In its declaration of February 26 the Provisional Government
stated that besides securing the right to work, the workers
must combine together before they could secure the full benefit
of their labour. The moment Louis Blanc attained to power he
sought to guide the energies of the commission in this direction.
The “Association” was to be of the nature of a co-operative productive
society, supported by the State. Under the influence of Buchez,
an old Saint-Simonian, a Republican Catholic and the founder of
the newspaper called <i>L’Atelier</i>, there had been formed in 1834 an
association of jewellers and goldsmiths.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> But it was a solitary
exception.</p>

<p>Louis Blanc was more fortunate. He successively founded
associations of tailors, of saddlers, of spinners and lace-makers, and
he secured Government orders for tunics, saddles, and epaulettes
for them. Other associations followed, and by July 5 the
National Assembly was sufficiently interested in these experiments
to vote the sum of three millions to their credit. A good portion of
this sum passed into the hands of mixed associations of masters and
men formed with the sole purpose of benefiting by the Government’s
liberality. The workmen’s associations pure and simple, however,
received more than a million, and there was not a sou of it left by
1849.</p>

<p>The first co-operative movement inspired by the ideas of
Louis Blanc was of short duration. The National Assembly took
good care to place the new societies under Ministerial control by
appointing a <i>Conseil d’Encouragement</i>, nominated by the Ministry to
fix the conditions under which loans should be granted. The
Conseil hastened to publish model regulations which left the associations
little scope for internal organisation. So stringent were the
rules that several of them were immediately jeopardised, and every
society which failed to conform to one of the three models outlined
in Article 19 of the Commercial Code was obliged to dissolve. This
meant every society which was not nominally a collective society,
a joint stock or a limited liability company. By 1855, according
to the testimony of Reybaud, there remained only nine out of those
subsidised in 1848. Consumers’ co-operative societies, that is, the
societies which aimed at securing cheap commodities, established
at Paris, Lille, Nantes, and Grenoble, were also dissolved.</p>

<p>And so all these experiments—the only ones that had not already
brought reformers into discredit—were destined to fail in their turn.
Their extinction was partly due to political causes, partly to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
founders, who had not yet been trained in the difficult task of
building up such associations.</p>

<p>The social experiments of 1848 one after another foundered,
bringing a distrust of theories in their train. There still remained
one other experiment connected with Proudhon’s name—that of
free credit. But it also was destined to fail like the rest.</p>

<h4 id="heading40">III: THE EXCHANGE BANK THEORY</h4>

<p>The Revolution of 1848 did not take Proudhon quite unawares,
although he considered the outbreak was rather sudden. He was
soon convinced that the real problem to be determined was economic
rather than political, but he also realised that the education
of the masses was too backward to permit of a peaceful solution.
Proudhon, in this matter at one with his French <i>confrères</i>, had
hoped for such a solution.<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> He thought the February Revolution
was a child prematurely born.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> In a striking article in the columns
of <i>Le Peuple</i> he gave wistful expression to his fears as he foresaw
the Revolution impending. Its solution had been delivered to none
and its interpretation baffled the ingenuity of all.</p>

<p>“I have wept over the poor workman, whose daily bread is already
sufficiently uncertain and who has now suffered misery for many
years. I have undertaken his defence, but I find that I am powerless
to succour him. I have mourned over the <i>bourgeois</i>, whose ruin I
have witnessed and who has been driven to bankruptcy and goaded
to opposition of the proletariat. My personal inclination is to
sympathise with the <i>bourgeois</i>, but a natural antagonism to his
ideas and the play of circumstance have made me his opponent.
I have gone in mourning and paid penance for the spirit of the
old Republic long before there were any signs of its offspring.
This Revolution which was to restore the public order merely marks
the beginning of a new departure in social revolution which no one
understands.”<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>But the Revolution having once begun, Proudhon did not feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
himself justified in being behindhand. He had been a most severe
critic of the existing <i>régime</i>, and he felt that he was bound to
attempt a solution of the practical problems which suddenly came
to the front. He became a journalist and threw himself whole-heartedly
into the struggle. Hitherto he had been content with
vague suggestions as to where the evil lay. But now he was anxious
to make reform practicable and to fill in the details of the scheme;
and so he invented the Exchange Bank.</p>

<p>Proudhon’s exposition of the scheme is contained in a number
of pamphlets, in newspapers, and in his books.<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The explanations
do not always tally, and he is not always happy in stating exactly
what he thinks. This explains why he has been so often misunderstood.
We shall try to give a <i>résumé</i> of his ideas before proceeding
to criticise them and to compare them with analogous projects
formulated both before and after his time. This will help us to
understand where the originality of the scheme lay.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle on which the whole scheme rests is
somewhat as follows: Of all the forms of capital which allow of
a right of escheat to the product of the worker, whether in the form
of rent, of interest, or of discount, the most important is money,
for it is only in the form of money that these dues are actually
paid.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> If we could suppress the right of escheat in the case of this
universal form of capital—in other words, if interest were abolished—the
right of escheat in every other case would soon disappear.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that by means of some organisation or other
money required for the purchase of land, machinery, and buildings
for industrial purposes could be procured without interest. Were
this the case the required capital would then be obtained in that
way instead of by payment of interest or rent as is the case to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
The suppression of money interest would enable the worker to
borrow capital gratuitously, and would give him immediate control
over all useful capital instead of renting it. All attempts to hold
up capital for the sake of receiving interest without labour would
thus be frustrated. The right of property would be reduced to
mere possession. Exchange would be reciprocal, and the worker
would secure all the produce of his labour without having to share
it with others. In short, economic justice would be secured.</p>

<p>This is all very well, but how can the necessary money be
obtained without paying interest? Everything depends upon that.</p>

<p>Proudhon invites us to consider what money really is. It is a
mere medium of exchange which is designed to facilitate the circulation
of goods. Proudhon, who had hitherto regarded money as
capital <i>par excellence</i>, now treats it as a mere instrument of exchange.
“Money by itself is of no use to me. I merely take it in order to part
with it. I can neither consume it nor cultivate it.”<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> It is a mere
medium of exchange, and the interest paid merely covers this cost
of circulation.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> But paper money will fulfil this function quite as
well and much more cheaply. Banks advance money in exchange
for commodities or supply bills which are immediately transferable
into cash. In exchange for this service the banker receives a
discount which goes to remunerate the shareholders who have
supplied the capital. Why not establish a bank without any capital
which, like the Bank of France, will discount goods with bills—either
circulation or exchange notes? The bills would be inconvertible,
and consequently would cost scarcely anything, and there would be
no capital to remunerate.</p>

<p>The service given would be equal to that given by the banks, but
would cost a great deal less. All that would be required to ensure
the circulation of the bills would be an understanding on the part
of the <i>clientèle</i> of the new bank that they would accept them as
payment for goods. The bearer would thus be certain that they
were always immediately exchangeable, just as if they were cash.
The clients would lose nothing by accepting them, for the statutes
would decree that the bank should never trade in anything except
goods actually delivered or under promise of delivery. The notes in
circulation would never exceed the demands of commerce. They
would always represent goods already produced and actually sold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
but not yet paid for.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Following the example of other banks, the
bank would advance to the seller of the goods a sum of money which
it would subsequently recover from the buyer. The merchants
and manufacturers would obtain not only their circulating capital
without payment of interest, but also the fixed capital necessary for
the founding of new industries. These advances obtained without
interest would enable them to buy and not merely to rent the
instruments of production which they needed.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>The consequences of a reform of this kind cannot be easily
enumerated. Not only would capital be freely placed at the disposal
of everyone, but every class distinction would disappear<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> as soon
as the worker ceased selling his products at cost price<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> and government
itself would become useless. The aim of all government is to
check the oppression of the weak by the strong.<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> But the moment
fair exchange becomes possible, free contract is sufficient to secure
this; there is no longer anyone who is oppressed. All are equally
favoured, for the cause of contention has been removed. “Once
capital and labour are identified, society will subsist of its own
accord, and there will no longer be any need for government.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Government has “its origin and its whole being immersed in the
economic system.” Proudhon’s system means anarchy—the absence
of government.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p>Such is Proudhon’s plan, and such its consequences. To understand
its full significance we must inquire whether (1) the substitution
of exchange notes for bank-notes payable at sight is practicable,
and, (2) supposing it to be practicable, if it is likely to have the effects
anticipated by its author.</p>

<p>Proudhon states that his system merely involves the universal
adoption of exchange notes.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> The Exchange Bank would merely
append the manager’s signature against the particular commodity
discounted. But the issue of bank-notes at the present time involves
nothing more than this. Instead of the bill of exchange which it now
buys, and which enjoys only a limited circulation because the signatories
have only a very limited credit, it is proposed that the Bank
of France should substitute a note bearing its own signature, which
is universally known and testifies to an illimitable amount of credit.
In what respects, then, does Proudhon’s circulating medium differ
from a bank-note? It differs simply in the fact that the signature of
the Bank of France involves a promise of reimbursement in metallic
money, a commodity universally accepted and demanded, while
Proudhon’s Exchange Bank enters into no such definite agreement,
but merely undertakes to accept it in lieu of payment.</p>

<p>Theoretically, perhaps, the difference may appear insignificant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
since the signatures are the only guarantee of the solvency of the
notes of the Bank of France and the Exchange Bank alike.
But in practice it is enormous. The certainty that the note can
be exchanged for money gives it a wide currency and makes it
acceptable to many people who rely implicitly upon their confidence
in the bank. They need give no thought to the question of its
solvency. A mere circulating medium, on the other hand, in addition
to transferring a claim to certain goods belonging to clients of the
bank, involves a certain amount of confidence in the solvency of
those clients—a confidence not always easily justified. A note of
this kind will only circulate among the bank’s <i>clientèle</i>. It will
never reach the general public as the bank-note actually does. The
clients themselves will keep their engagements just so long as the
bank continues to discount goods that have actually been delivered
and never refuses payment when it falls due. Failing this, the
exchange notes, instead of regularly returning to the bank, will
remain in circulation. A slight crisis or a little tension, and many
of the clients will become insolvent. The total nominal value of
the exchange notes will quickly surpass the actual value of the goods
which they represent. There will be a rapid depreciation, and clients
even will refuse to take them.</p>

<p>It is just possible to conceive of the circulation of such exchange
notes, but the area of circulation will be a very limited one, and it
will be utterly impossible if all the clients are not perfectly solvent.</p>

<p>Let us, however, suppose that the practical difficulties have
been overcome, and that the exchange notes are already in circulation.
Interest will not disappear even then, and herein lies the essential
weakness of the system.</p>

<p>Why does the Bank of France charge a discount? Is it, as
Proudhon suggests, because it supplies cash in return for a bill of
exchange, so that “the seigneurial right of discount”<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> would disappear
with the adoption of a non-metallic currency? The bank
charges discount simply because it gives a certain quantity of
merchandise immediately exchangeable in return for a bill of
exchange falling due some months hence. It gives a tangible
commodity in exchange for a promise—a present good for a future.
What the bank takes is the difference between the present value of
the bill of exchange and its value when it falls due. It is not the
mere whim of the banker or the employment of a particular kind of
money that gives rise to discount. It belongs to the very nature
of things. Proudhon notwithstanding, a sale for cash and a sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
with future payment must remain two different operations,<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> at least
as long as the actual possession of a good is judged to be more
advantageous than its future possession.</p>

<p>This difference, even in the case of the Exchange Bank, would
very soon reappear. The exchange notes would represent goods
which were to be sold at a certain date. Although the Bank may
refuse to discount, this will not lessen the advantage enjoyed by
those merchants who are paid in cash. In order to secure this
advantage they will enter into agreement with those buyers who pay
cash either in the form of goods or of precious metals (which are,
after all, commodities), granting a slight rebate on the paper price.
There would thus be two sets of prices, the paper prices of goods
sold for future payment and the money price of goods sold for cash.
The first would be higher than the second, and the difference—refused
by the banks—would be pocketed by the sellers. Money
interest would then reappear under a new form.</p>

<p>To this Proudhon would reply that the clients of the bank, under
the terms of their agreement, are debarred from taking any such
premiums. Of course, if they remained faithful to their promises
interest or discount would be suppressed; but this would result, not
from the organisation of the Exchange Bank, but because of mutual
agreement. This would be a purely moral reform requiring no
banking contrivance to aid it, but one in which progress must
inevitably be very slow.</p>

<p>The Bank of Exchange failing to suppress discount, or to check
the right of escheat in general, Proudhon’s other conclusions fall to
the ground.</p>

<p>His theoretical error consists in his treating money at one
moment as capital <i>par excellence</i>, at another as a mere medium of
exchange having no value. He forgets that money is desired not
merely for purposes of exchange, but also as a store of value, as the
proper instrument for hoarding and saving; and although the
exchange notes may replace it in one respect, they fail in another.
We may increase the circulating media at pleasure, but we cannot
multiply our capital. Money may be replaced by goods, but this will
not add a single franc to the capital which already exists in society,
of which money itself is a part. Nor will it lessen the superior value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of present as compared with future goods—a superiority which
gives rise to the phenomenon of interest. The only result of multiplying
the exchange notes without increasing the amount of social
capital would be to raise prices as a whole, the price of land, houses,
and machinery as well as the price of consumption goods. Capital
would be lent as before, and being less plentiful the high rate of
interest or rent would tend to maintain the high level of prices, and
these would in turn be still further increased—a strange outcome of
a reform intended to lower them! Proudhon, having exaggerated
the evil effects of gold, now accepts Say’s formula too literally.
J. B. Say allowed himself to be led into error by his own formula
that “Goods exchange for goods,” and it is interesting to note that
the Exchange Bank is the logical, though somewhat paradoxical,
outcome of the reaction against the Mercantilist ideas concerning
money which can be traced to Adam Smith and the Physiocrats.</p>

<p>This does not imply that Proudhon’s idea is devoid of truth.
The false ideal of free credit contains the germ of a true ideal, namely,
mutual credit. The Bank of France is a society of capitalists whose
credit is established by the public who accept their notes. They
really deal in public credit. Proudhon saw clearly enough that
their notes are ultimately guaranteed by the public. The public are
the true signatories of these commercial goods. Were the public
insolvent the bank would never recover its advances, which really
constitute the security for the bills. The shareholders’ capital is
only a supplementary guarantee. The Comte Mollien, the Financial
Minister of Napoleon I, declared that in theory a bank of issue
should be able to operate without any capital. The public lends
money to itself through the intermediary, the bank. Why not
operate without the intermediary? Why not eliminate the <i>entrepreneur</i>
of credit just as the industrial or commercial <i>entrepreneur</i>
is eliminated in the case of the co-operative society? Discount
would not disappear altogether, perhaps, but the rate of discount
for borrowers would be diminished in proportion to the extent
to which they stood to gain as lenders. This is the principle of
the mutual credit society, where the initial capital is almost
entirely superseded, its place being taken by the joint liability
of the co-operators. Proudhon’s initial conception seems to be
reducible to this very simple idea.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems that Proudhon was merely following the idea of a
co-operative credit bank, just as in other parts of the work he copies
other forms of co-operation without ever showing much sympathy
for the principle itself.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>In addition to a correct conception of the value of mutual credit,
there runs throughout his whole system a more fundamental idea
which helps to distinguish it from other forms of official socialism
which arose either before or after his time. This is his profound
belief in individual liberty as the indispensable motive of economic
activity in industrial societies. He realised better than any of his
predecessors that economic liberty is a definite acquisition of
modern societies, and that every true reform must be based on
liberty. He has estimated the strength of spontaneous economic
forces more clearly than anyone else. He has demonstrated
their pernicious effects, but at the same time he has recognised,
as Adam Smith had done, that this was the most powerful lever of
progress. His passionate love of justice explains his hatred of
private property, and his jealous belief in liberty aroused his hostility
to socialism. Despite his famous formula, <i>Destruam et ædificabo</i>,
he destroyed more than he built. His liberalism rested on his
profound hold of economic realities, and the social problem of to-day,
as Proudhon clearly saw, is how to combine justice with liberty.</p>

<p>Proudhon’s project for an Exchange Bank must not be confused
with analogous schemes that have appeared either before or after his
day. All these schemes have a common basis in a reform of exchange
as a remedy for social inequalities. Apart from this one idea the
resemblance is frequently superficial, and the economic bases differ
considerably.</p>

<p>(1) Proudhon’s idea has often been contrasted with Robert Owen’s
labour notes, and with the scheme prepared by Mr. Bray in 1839,
in a work entitled <i>Labour’s Wrongs and Labour’s Remedy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
with the later system outlined by Rodbertus. Proudhon’s circulating
notes have nothing in common with the labour notes described by
these writers. The circulating notes represent commercial goods
produced for the purpose of private exchange. Prices are freely
fixed by buyer and seller, and they bear no relation to the labour
time, as is the case with the labour notes. The final result, doubtless,
was expected to be the same. Proudhon hoped that in this
way the price of goods, now that it was no longer burdened with
interest on capital, would equal cost of production. This result
was to be obtained indirectly. The economic errors in the two
cases are also different. Proudhon’s error lay in his failure to realise
that metallic money is a merchandise as well as an instrument of
circulation. The error of Owen, of Bray, and of Rodbertus consisted
of a failure to see that the price of goods includes something
more than the mere amount of labour which they have
cost to produce—an error which Proudhon at any rate did not
commit.</p>

<p>(2) Proudhon’s bank has also been confused with other banks of
exchange which are really quite different. The ideas underlying
such schemes had become prominent before Proudhon’s days, and
numerous practical experiments had been attempted along the lines
indicated. These banks aimed, not at the suppression of interest,
but at a gradual <i>rapprochement</i> between producer and consumer,
the goods offered for sale being bought by the bank, and paid for in
exchange notes upon an agreed basis of calculation. Buyers in
their turn would come to the bank to obtain the necessaries of life,
paying for them in exchange notes. An experiment of this kind
was made by a certain Fulcrand Mazel in 1829.<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> In this case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
bank was merely an <i>entrepôt</i> which facilitated the marketing of the
goods produced. Such a system is open to the objection that the
value of the notes issued in payment for goods would necessarily
vary with the fluctuations in the value of these goods during the
interval which would elapse between the time they are taken in by
the bank and their eventual purchase by consumers. Proudhon’s
plan was to discount the goods already bought or actually delivered.
The bank would only advance what was actually promised, but
would make no charge for accommodation. Depreciation could
only arise if the buyer were insolvent. It could never result from
a fall in price as a result of a diminished demand for the product.
Proudhon renounced all dealings with solidarity when he dismissed
Mazel’s project.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) M. Solvay, a Belgian <i>entrepreneur</i>, has recently elaborated a
scheme of “social accounting.” He also proposes the suppression
of metallic money and the introduction of a perfect system of
payment. Here, however, the analogy ends.</p>

<p>What Solvay proposed was the replacement of metallic money,
not by bank-notes, but by a system of cheques and clearing-houses.
His plan owes its inspiration to the modern development of the
clearing-house system. Solvay thought that the system might be
so extended as to make the employment of money entirely
unnecessary. To every such clearing-house the State would hand
over a cheque-book, covering a sum varying with the amount of
real or personal property which the house possessed. This cheque-book
was to have two columns, one for receipts, the other for expenditure.
Whenever any commodity was sold, the liquidation of debt
would be effected by the buyer’s stamping the book on the receipt
side and the seller’s stamping it on the expenditure side. As soon
as the total value of these transactions equalled the initial sum
which the cheque-book was supposed to represent the book would
be returned to the State bureau, where each individual account
would be made up. “In this way everybody’s receipts and
expenditure will always be known with absolute clearness.”<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>The advantage of such a system would in the first place consist
in the economy of metallic money. In the second place it would
furnish the State with information as to the extent of everybody’s
fortune. The State would then be in possession of the information
necessary for setting up an equable scheme of succession duties which
would gradually suppress the hereditary transmission of acquired
fortune. Such gradual suppression would result in the total extinction
of the fundamental injustice of modern society, namely, the
inequality of opportunity.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> It would also help the application of that
other principle of distributive justice, namely, “to each according
as he produces.” The idea is Saint-Simon’s rather than Proudhon’s.</p>

<p>The scope of the proposed reform is quite clear. Social accounting,
according to Solvay, is a mere element in a more general
conception, that of “productivism,” which in various ways is to
result in increasing productivity to its maximum.<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>In all this it is impossible to see anything of Proudhon’s ideas.
With the exception of the suggestion of suppressing metallic money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the fundamental conceptions are utterly different. M. Solvay
makes no pretence to ability to suppress interest, and he never
imagines that money is the cause of interest. The cheque and
clearing system is a mere device for facilitating cash payment. It
has nothing in common with the Proudhonian system, whereby
circulating notes are supposed to place credit sales and cash payments
on an equal footing.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>The most serious objection to Solvay’s system lies in the fact
that the suppression of money as a circulating medium must also
involve its suppression as a measure of value. It seems difficult to
imagine that the universal cheque bank with no monetary support
would not result in a rapid inflation of prices because of the superabundance
of paper. But although the particular process advocated
by Solvay is open to criticism there can be no objection to his desire
to diminish the quantity of metallic money or to further the ideal of
equal opportunity for all.</p>

<p>The project was never successfully put into practice. Like the
cognate ideas of “the right to work,” “the organisation of labour,”
and “working men’s associations,” the idea of “free credit” has
left behind it a mere memory of a sudden check.</p>

<p>On January 31, 1849, Proudhon, in the presence of a notary,
set up a society known as the People’s Bank, with a view to
showing the practicability of free credit. The actual organisation
differs considerably from the theoretical outline of the Exchange
Bank. The Exchange Bank was to have no capital: the People’s
Bank had a capital of 5,000,000 francs, divided into shares of the
value of 5 francs each. The Exchange Bank was to suppress
metallic money: the People’s Bank had to be content with issuing
notes against certain kinds of commercial goods only. The Exchange
Bank was to suppress interest: the People’s Bank fixed it at 2 per
cent., expecting that it could be reduced to a minimum of ¼ per cent.</p>

<p>Despite these important changes the bank would not work. At
the end of three months the subscribed capital was only 18,000 francs,
although the number of subscribers was almost 12,000. Just at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
that moment—March 25, 1849—Proudhon was brought before the
Seine Assize Court to answer for two articles published on January 16
and 27, 1849, containing an attack on Louis Bonaparte. He was
sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and fined 3000 francs. On
April 11 he announced that the experiment would be discontinued,
and that “events had already proved too strong for it,” which
seemed to suggest that he had lost faith in the scheme.</p>

<p>From that moment free credit falls into the background, and
political and social considerations obtain first place in his later works.</p>

<h4 id="heading41">IV: PROUDHON’S INFLUENCE AFTER 1848</h4>

<p>It is extremely difficult to follow the influence of Proudhon’s thought
after 1848.</p>

<p>Karl Marx, who was almost unknown in 1848, became by the
publication of his <i>Kapital</i> in 1867 practically the sole representative
of theoretical socialism. Marx’s <i>Misère de la Philosophie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> published
in 1847, is a bitter criticism of the <i>Contradictions économiques</i>, and
shows how violently he was opposed to Proudhon’s ideas. To the
champion of collectivism the advocate of peasant proprietorship is
scarcely comprehensible; the theorist of class war can hardly be
expected to sympathise with the advocate of class fusion, the revolutionary
with the pacificist.<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> The success of Marx’s ideas after 1867<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
cast all previous social systems into the shade. Proudhon, he
thought, was a mere <i>petit bourgeois</i>. When the celebrated International
Working Men’s Association was being founded in London in
1864 the Parisian workmen who took part in it seemed to be entirely
under the influence of Proudhon. At the first International Congress,
held at Geneva in 1866, a memorial was presented which bore clear
indications of Proudhon’s influence, and its recommendations were
adopted. At the following Congress, in 1867, Proudhon’s ideas met
with a more determined resistance, and by the time of the Congress
of Brussels (1868), and that of Basle (1869), Marx’s influence had
become predominant.</p>

<p>One might even doubt whether the Proudhonian ideas defended
by the Parisian workmen in 1866 were really those of the Proudhon
of 1848. They seemed much more akin to the thesis of his last
work, <i>La Capacité politique des Classes ouvrières</i>, published in 1865.
This book was itself written under the inspiration of a working men’s
movement which had arisen in Paris after 1862 as the result of a
manifesto signed by sixty Parisian workmen. This manifesto had
been submitted to Proudhon as the best known representative of
French socialism. The attitude of the French workmen at the
opening of the “International,” then, was the effect of a revival of
Proudhonism as the outcome of the publication of this new volume
rather than a persistence of the ideas of 1848.<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>The revival was of short duration. Since then, however, the
Marxian ideas have been submitted to very thorough criticism, and
certain recent writers have displayed an entirely new interest in
Proudhon’s ideas. These writers, chief among whom is M. Georges
Sorel, combine a great admiration for Marx with a no less real
respect for Proudhon. But even in this case it is difficult to speak
of the movement as a revival of Proudhon’s ideas. It is rather a
new current which owes its inspiration to syndicalism and combines
French anarchy and German collectivism. In any case, it is so
recent that we cannot yet determine its full import.</p>

<h2 id="BOOK_III_LIBERALISM">BOOK III: LIBERALISM</h2>

<p>It is time we returned to the Classical writers. Now that the
combat had grown fierce among its critics, we are anxious to know
what the Classical school itself was doing to repel the onslaughts of
the enemy. Its apparent quiescence must not mislead us into the
belief that it was already extinct. Although the great works of
Ricardo, Malthus, and Say were produced early in the century,
it cannot be said that economic literature even after that period,
especially in England, had remained at a standstill. But no work
worthy of comparison with the writings of the first masters or their
eloquent critics had as yet appeared. Now, however, the science
was to captivate the public ear a second time, and for a short period
at least to unite its many votaries.</p>

<p>But the union was no true one. The Classical school itself was
about to break up into two camps, the English and the French. In
no sense can they be regarded as rivals, for they are defenders of the
same cause. They are both champions of the twin principles of
Liberalism and Individualism. But while the first, with John
Stuart Mill as its leader, lent a sympathetic ear to the vigorous
criticism now rampant everywhere, which claimed that the older
theories ought to yield place to the new, the French school, on the
other hand, with Bastiat as its chief, struggled against all innovation,
and reaffirmed its faith in the “natural order” and <i>laissez-faire</i>.</p>

<p>This divergence really belongs to the origin of the science. Traces
of it may be discovered if we compare the Physiocrats with Adam
Smith, or J. B. Say with Ricardo; but it was now accentuated, for
reasons that we shall presently indicate.</p>

<p>Our third Book naturally divides itself into two parts, the one
devoted to the French Liberal school, the other to the English.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I_THE_OPTIMISTS">CHAPTER I: THE OPTIMISTS</h3>

<p>The previous Book has shown us the unsettled state of economic
science. It has also indicated how the science was turned from its
original course by reverses suffered at the hands of criticism, socialism,
and interventionism, which were now vigorous everywhere. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
time had come for an attempt to bring economic science back into
its true path and to its old allegiance to the “natural order,” a
position which it had renounced since the days of the Physiocrats
and Adam Smith. This was the task more especially undertaken
by the French economists.</p>

<p>The attitude of the French school is not difficult to explain, for
the French economists found themselves faced by both socialism
and Protection. We must never forget that France is the classic
land of socialism.<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> The influence exercised in England by Owen
and in Germany by Weitling or Schuster is unworthy of comparison
with the exalted <i>rôle</i> played by Saint-Simon, Fourier, or Proudhon in
France. The latter writers wielded a veritable charm, not merely
over working men, but also over the intellectuals, and on that
account were all the more dangerous, in the opinion of economists.</p>

<p>French Protection was never represented by such a prominent
champion as Germany had in List, but it was none the less active.
Protection in England succumbed after a feeble resistance to the
repeal movement led by Cobden, but in France it was powerful
enough to resist the campaign inaugurated by Bastiat. It is true
that Napoleon III suppressed it, but it soon reappeared, as vigorous
as ever.</p>

<p>The French school had thus to meet two adversaries, disguised
as one; for Protection was but a counterfeit of socialism, and all
the more hateful because it claimed to increase the happiness of
proprietors and manufacturers—of the wealthy; while socialists did
at least aim at increasing the happiness of the workers—of the poor.
Protection was also more injurious, for being in operation its
ravages were already felt, whereas the other, happily, was still at
the Utopian stage. But in hitting at both adversaries at once the
French school discovered that it possessed this advantage: it was
free from the reproach that it was serving the interests of a particular
class, and could confidently reply that it was fighting for the common
good.</p>

<p>A war of a hundred years can scarcely fail to leave a mark
upon the nation which bears the brunt of it, and we think that this
affords some explanation of the apologetic tendencies and of the
normative and finalistic hypotheses for which the French school
has so often been reproached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>It is necessary that we should try to understand the line of
argument adopted by the French writers in defending the
optimistic doctrines which they so easily mistook for the science
itself. They argued somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>“Pessimism is the great source of evil. The sombre prophecies
of the pessimists have destroyed all belief in ‘natural’ laws and in
the spontaneous organisation of society, and men have been driven
to seek for better fortune in artificial organisation. What is especially
needed to refute the attacks of the critics, both socialists and
Protectionists, is to free the science from the compromising attitude
adopted by Malthus and Ricardo, and to show that their so-called
‘laws’ have no real foundation. We must strive to show that
natural laws lead, not to evil, but to good, although the path
thither be sometimes by way of evil; that individual interests are
at bottom one, and only superficially antagonistic; that, as Bastiat
put it, if everyone would only follow his own interest he would
unwittingly find that he was advancing the interests of all.” In a
word, if pessimism is to be refuted it can only be by the establishment
of optimism.</p>

<p>It is true that the French school protests against the adjective
“optimistic,” and refuses to be called “orthodox.” Its protests would
be justified if optimism implied quietism—that selfish contentment
of the well-to-do <i>bourgeois</i> who feels that everything is for the best
in this best of all worlds—or the attenuated humanitarianism of
those who think that they can allay suffering by kind words or good
deeds. It is nothing of the kind. We have already protested
against interpreting <i>laissez-faire</i> as a mere negation of all activity.
It ought to be accepted in the English sense of fair play and of
keeping a clear field for the combatants. The economists both of
the past and of the present have always been indefatigable wranglers
and controversialists of the first order, and they have never hesitated
to denounce abuses. But their optimism is based upon the belief
that the prevalence of evil in the economic structure is due to the
imperfect realisation of liberty. The best remedy for these defects
is greater and more perfect liberty;<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> hence the title “Liberal,”
to which the school lays claim. The liberty of the worker is the
best guarantee against the exploitation of his labour and the
reduction of wages. M. Émile Ollivier, the author of the law which
suppressed combination fines, declared that freedom of combination
would put an end to strikes. Free loans would cause the disappearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of usury. Freedom of trade would put an end to the adulteration
of goods and the reign of trusts. Competition would everywhere
secure cheap production and just distribution.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>This optimism, strengthened and intensified, deepened their
distrust of every kind of social reform undertaken with a view to
protecting the weak, whether by the masters themselves or through
the intervention of the State. Liberty, so they thought, would
finally remedy the evils which it seemed to create, while State
intervention merely aggravated the evils it sought to correct.<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<p>What seems still more singular is their scant respect for “associationism”
as outlined in our previous chapter. It found just as
little favour as State control. They did not display quite the
same contempt for it as was shown by the Revolutionists. It was
no longer actually condemned, and they put forward a formal plea
for the right of combination, in politics, in religion, industry,
commerce, and labour. But they always interpreted it as a mere
right of coalition or association with a view to protecting or
strengthening individual activity. Association as an instrument
of social transformation that would set up co-operation in place of
competition, and which in the name of solidarity demanded certain
sacrifices from the individual for the sake of the community, was not
to the liking of the Liberal Individualist school. Even the less
ambitious and less complete forms, such as the co-operative and
the mutual aid society, seemed to them to be full of illusions and
deceptions, if not actually vicious.<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of the French school is its
unbounded faith in individual liberty. This distinctive trait has
never been lacking throughout the century and a half that separates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
us from the time of the Physiocrats. Its most eminent representatives,
while spurning the title Orthodox or Classical, have repeatedly
declared that they wish for no other name than Liberal.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>It is also marked by a certain want of sympathy with the masses
in their sufferings. Science, doubtless, does not make for sympathy.
But what we merely wish to note is the presence of a certain tendency—already
very pronounced in Malthus—to believe that people’s
misfortunes result from their vices or their improvident habits.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>
The Liberal school was quite prepared to extend an enthusiastic
welcome to the teaching of Darwin. He pointed out that a necessary
condition of progress was the natural selection of the best by the
elimination of the incapable, and that the price paid is not a bit too
high. Belief in the virtue of competition led to the glorification of
the struggle for life.</p>

<p>But the Liberal school failed to demonstrate the goodness of all
natural laws; neither did it succeed in arresting the progress of either
socialism or Protection. The end of the nineteenth century found
it submerged beneath the waters of both currents. Yet it never
once lost confidence. Its fidelity to principle, its continuity of
doctrine, its resolute, noble disdain of unpopularity, have won for it
a unique position; and it deserves better than the summary judgment
of foreign economists, who describe it as devoid of all originality,
or at best as only a pale reflection of the doctrine of Adam Smith.</p>

<p>In this chapter we are to study the period when Liberalism and
Optimism were at the height of their fame. It runs from 1830 to 1850.
It was during this epoch that the union of political and economic
liberty took place. Henceforth they are combined in a single cult
known as Liberalism. Economic liberty—that is, the free choice of
vocation and the free exchange of the fruits of one’s toil—no longer
figured in the category of necessary liberties, alongside of liberty of
conscience or freedom of the press. Like the others it was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the successes already achieved by democracy or civilisation, and to
attempt to suppress it was as vain as to try to make a river flow
backward. It was just a part of the wider movement towards
freedom from all servitude.</p>

<p>The appearance of political economy at the time when the old
<i>régime</i> was showing signs of disintegration is not without significance.
The Physiocrats, who were the first Liberal Optimists, were unjustly
ignored and neglected by their own descendants, not because of their
economic errors so much as because of their political doctrines,
especially their acceptance of legal despotism, which seemed to the
Liberals of 1830, if not an actual monstrosity, at least a sufficiently
typical survival of the old <i>régime</i> to discredit the whole Physiocratic
system.<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<p>Charles Dunoyer’s book, which appeared in 1845,<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> and which
bears the significant title of <i>De la Liberté du Travail, ou simple Exposé
des Conditions dans lesquelles les Forces humaines s’exercent avec le plus
de Puissance</i>, exactly marks this era of politico-economic Liberalism.
But although Dunoyer’s book is a eulogy of liberty in all its forms,
especially its competitive aspects, the optimistic note is not so
marked as it is in another much more celebrated work which
appeared about the same date—<i>Les Harmonies économiques</i> of
Bastiat (1850). The <i>Harmonies</i> and the other works of Bastiat
contain all the essential traits of the Liberal doctrine. His extreme
optimism and his belief in final causes have been disavowed by a
great many of the Liberal economists, but he remains the best
known figure of the Optimistic Liberal group, and possibly of the
whole French school.</p>

<p>Another economist whose name is inseparably linked with the
Optimistic doctrine, and of whom we have already made some
mention, is the American Carey.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> In many respects Carey ought to
be given first place, were it only because of his priority as a writer,
and especially, perhaps, since he accuses Bastiat of plagiarism. In
his treatment of certain aspects of the subject, such as the question
of method, in the logical consistency of his argument, and in the scope
of his discussion of such a problem as that of rent, he displays a
marked superiority. In our exposition of Bastiat’s doctrine we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
give to Carey’s the attention which it deserves. Our decision to give
Bastiat and not Carey the central position in this chapter is due in
the first place to the consideration that we are writing primarily
for French students, who will be more frequently called upon to read
Bastiat than Carey; and in the second place to the fact that the
works of the American economist appeared at a time when economic
instruction scarcely existed in the United States, and consequently
his writings never exercised the same influence as those of the
French economist, which appeared just when the war of ideas was
at its fiercest. Finally, Carey’s doctrine is lacking in the beautiful
unity of conception of the <i>Harmonies</i>, so that alongside of the
advocacy of free competition among individuals is presented an
outline of national Protection. Thus we have been forced to
divide our treatment of Carey into two sections. The heterogeneous,
not to say contradictory, character of his doctrines accounts for his
appearing in two different chapters.</p>

<p>Bastiat,<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> both at home and abroad, has always been regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the very incarnation of <i>bourgeois</i> political economy. Proudhon,
Lassalle in his famous pamphlet <i>Bastiat Schulze-Delitzsch</i>, Cairnes,
Sidgwick, Marshall, and Böhm-Bawerk all think of him as the
advocate of the existing order. None of them considers him a
scientific writer. They treat his writings as a kind of amplification
of Franklin’s <i>Poor Richard’s Almanac</i>, where apologues take the
place of demonstration and a much-vaunted transparency of style
is simply due to absence of thought.</p>

<p>Bastiat deserves a juster estimate. The man who wrote that
“if capital merely exists for the advantage of the capitalist I am
prepared to become a socialist,” or who declared that “one important
service that still requires to be done for political economy is to
write the history of spoliation,” was not a mere well-to-do <i>bourgeois</i>.
It is true that he carried the “isms” of the French school to absurd
lengths. An unkind fate decreed that his contribution should
mark the culminating-point of the doctrine, to be followed by the
inevitable reaction. To the force of that reaction he had to bow,
and his whole work was demolished.</p>

<p>Bastiat’s arguments against socialism are somewhat antiquated,
but so are the peculiar forms of socialist organisation which he had
in view when writing. This is not true of the arguments dealing with
Protection. These have not been entirely useless. Though they
failed to check the policy of Protection, they definitely invalidated
some of its arguments. If modern Protectionists no longer speak of
the “inundation of a country” or of an “invasion of foreign goods,”
and if the old and celebrated argument concerning national labour is
less frequently invoked as a kind of final appeal, we too often forget
that all this is due to the small but admirable pamphlets written by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Bastiat. Such were <i>The Petition of the Candle-makers</i> and <i>The
Complaint of the Left Hand against the Right</i>. No one could more
scornfully show the laughable inconsistency of tunnelling the
mountains which divide countries, with a view to facilitating
exchange, while at the same time setting up a customs barrier at
each end; or expose the patent contradiction involved in guaranteeing
a minimum revenue to the landed proprietors and capitalists by
the establishment of protective rights, while refusing a minimum
wage to the worker. No one has better emphasised the difficulty
of justifying an import duty as compared with an ordinary tax, for
a tax is levied upon the individual for the benefit of all, while a
duty is levied upon all for the benefit of the few.</p>

<p>He has not been quite so happy in his exposition of individualism.
The problem has been over-simplified: individual and international
exchange have been treated as if they were on all fours. Analogies,
more amusing than solid, are employed to show that the advantages
of international trade are greater if a country has an unfavourable
balance against it, and that international exchange benefits poor
countries most.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p>The thesis of the constructive portion of his work is as follows:
“The general laws of the social world are in harmony with one
another, and in every way tend to the perfection of humanity.”
<i>A priori</i>, however, are we not confronted with rank disorder everywhere?
To that he replies in his well-known apologue, “Things
are not what they seem,” pointing out that we cannot always
trust what we see, and that what is not seen is very often true.
Apparent antagonisms on closer view often reveal harmonious
elements. But man’s freedom sometimes breaks the harmony and
destroys the liberty of others. Especially is this the case with
spoliation, which Bastiat never attempts to justify, but denounces
whenever he has the chance. But around man and within him are
diverse forces which must lead him the way of the good, deviate he
never so often, and which will finally and automatically re-establish
the harmony. “My belief is that evil, far from being antagonistic
to the good, in some mysterious way promotes it, while the good
can never end in evil. In the final reckoning the good must surely
triumph.”<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>It is quite evident that this doctrine goes far beyond the conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of “natural laws,” and implies a belief in a Providential
order. Bastiat never shrinks from this position. He never misses
an opportunity of declaring his faith in language much clearer than
that of the Physiocrats. “God,” he writes, “has placed within each
individual an irresistible impulse towards the good, and a never-failing
light which enables him to discern it.”<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>Auguste Comte has delivered an eloquent protest against the vain
and irrational disposition to think that only the spontaneous can
be regarded as conforming to the “order” of nature. Were this
the case any practical difficulty “that presented itself in the course
of industrial development could only be met with a kind of solemn
resignation under the express sanction of political economy.”<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>Even as an exposition of the Providential order Bastiat’s faith
is not easy to justify. It by no means agrees with the Christian
teaching on the point. For we cannot forget that although Scripture
teaches us that both man and nature were declared good when first
created by God, it also teaches that both have been entirely perverted
by man’s iniquity, and that never will they become good of their
own accord, since there is no natural means of salvation.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> Christian
people are exhorted to kill the natural man within them and to
foster the growth of the new man. Christianity promises a new
heaven and a new earth—an infinitely more revolutionary doctrine
than that of the economic Optimists. Bastiat’s God is, after all, just
“<i>Le Dieu des bonnes gens</i>” whose praises are sung by Béranger.</p>

<p>What are the facts of this pre-established harmony? What are
its laws, and where are they operative? They are in evidence
everywhere, Bastiat thinks—in value and exchange, in the institution
of private property, in competition, production and consumption,
etc. We shall content ourselves with a consideration
of the circumstances under which Bastiat thought it was most clearly
seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="heading42">I: THE THEORY OF SERVICE-VALUE</h4>

<p>First of all we have the law of value, “which is to political economy
what numbers are to arithmetic.”<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>Ricardo taught that value was determined by the quantity of
labour necessary for production. This theory is entirely at one
with Bastiat’s, and he would have felt no compunction about
inserting it in the <i>Harmonies</i>, for a theory of value which showed
that every form of property is really based upon labour seemed to
accord with the requirements of justice. But although Bastiat’s
method was almost exclusively deductive, and as little realistic as
possible, he could never content himself with an explanation which
was all too clearly in conflict with the facts. Such a theory could
never explain why the value of a pearl accidentally discovered
should equal the value of another laboriously brought from the
depths of the sea. Accordingly he sought another explanation,
juster, and more in accordance with facts, than Ricardo’s.</p>

<p>Carey effected just the needed correction of the Ricardian theory,
by propounding another ingenious explanation, namely, that value
is determined, not by the quantity of labour actually employed in
production, but by the quantity of labour saved. This would
account for those facts that refused to fit in with the Ricardian
theory, and the chance pearl was no longer a stumbling-block.
Bastiat was evidently attracted by this theory.<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> But his satisfaction
was by no means complete, for it is not quite clear how a value
which is proportional to the amount of labour saved—that is, to
labour which never has been and never will be undertaken—can be
considered as an economic harmony. But a ray of light illumines
the darkness. The labour saved is a kind of service rendered to the
person who acquires the commodity. The long-sought explanation
is found at last! “Value is the ratio between two exchanged
services.”<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> And, seeing that individual property and private fortunes
represent sums of values, we might say that a person’s property
is merely the sum of the services rendered by him. Herein lies the
harmony. Nothing better could be wished for, and Bastiat exults
in his discovery. Everything becomes quite clear, every contradiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
is removed, every difficulty solved, if we take for our starting-point
the crux of economic theory—namely, why diamonds are considered
more valuable than water. The diamond is more valuable
simply because the person who gives it to me is rendering me a
greater service than he who merely gives me a glass of water. This
was not the case on the Medusan raft, but even in that instance,
seeing that the service rendered was incalculable, the value must
have been immense.</p>

<p>Every solution propounded by economists—utility, scarcity,
difficulty of acquisition, cost of production, labour—is included
within this conception of service, and “economists of all shades of
opinion ought to feel satisfied.” “My decision is favourable to
every one of them, for they have all seen some aspect of the truth;
error being on the other side of the shield.”<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> Moreover, the word
“service” has the advantage of including, besides value properly
so called (that is, the price of goods), the price of all productive
services such as appear under the heads of loans, rent, discount, and
interest—in short, “everything that can be said to render a service.”<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>One cannot help smiling at Bastiat’s naïve exultation, for he
never realises that his formula is so comprehensive and includes
everything within itself simply because it is an empty form—a mere
<i>passe-partout</i>. It really amounts to saying that value depends upon
desirability, and we are not so much farther on after all.<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> On
closer view, it even lacks that apologetic tone which evidently
attracted Bastiat to it. It legitimises neither value nor property,
and even if it did it would simply be by the help of a hypocritical
formula, for the word “service” gives rise to the belief that all value
implies a benefit for those who receive it and a virtue in those who
give it. But very frequently it is nothing of the kind. The owner
of a house or of a piece of land in the city of London which is let
or sold at a fabulous price, the capitalist who lends money to a
needy borrower at a usurious rate, or the politician even who in
return for an enormous bribe secures some financial concession,
cannot be said to be rendering any real service, for all these have
either been solicited or demanded, or perhaps even extorted under
pressure. Such abnormal rates of discount, interest, or rent can
find no place in Bastiat’s formula. From a moral and ethical point
of view it is equally futile. It is a mere mask which affords protection
as well to the worst exploiter as to the honest tradesman: all are
thrown promiscuously into the “universal harmony.”<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite the justness of these criticisms, and although Bastiat’s
attempt to explain value by employing the term “service” must
be regarded as futile, the word has not remained a mere ingenious
epithet. On the contrary, it has won for itself a permanent place
in economic terminology. We shall again meet with it in the
vocabulary of that school which prides itself upon the exactness of
its method, namely, the Hedonistic and Mathematical school. These
later writers constantly make use of the term “productive services,”
and would find it hard to discover another word having a sufficiently
wide connotation.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> It is true that the word “service” with
all the noble associations of unselfish interest and professional honour
which cling to it (compare the phrase “his Majesty’s service”), may
lead us astray as to the economic arrangements of society, and that
a recollection of the less distinguished uses of the term may cause
us to doubt the wisdom of Bastiat’s choice. Still, it is the best that
we can imagine when speaking of the society of the future. It is
employed in the same sense as Auguste Comte used the term “social
function,” or as the equivalent of Marshall’s “economic chivalry.”<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
In attempting to present to ourselves the society of the future, or at
least the society of our dreams, we must hope that the present
incentive to economic activity, which is merely the desire for profit,
will gradually give place to the idea of social service. When that
day dawns a statue ought to be erected to the memory of Bastiat.</p>

<h4 id="heading43">II: THE LAW OF FREE UTILITY AND RENT</h4>

<p>Ricardo’s law of rent was the optimist’s nightmare. Should it by
any chance prove true, then the institution of property must be
abandoned altogether, and victory must lie with the socialists,
whom the economists regarded as somewhat of a social nuisance.
It was necessary, then, at all costs, to show that this law had in
reality no foundation, and with this end in view Bastiat attempts
to defend the paradox that nature or land gratuitously gives its
products to all men. But must we really say that corn and coal,
the products of soil and mine, literally do not pay for the trouble of
getting them? In other words, have they no value? Bastiat
replies that they doubtless possess some value, but that the price
paid for them does not cover the natural utility of those products.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
It merely covers cost of production, and is only just sufficient to
reimburse the proprietor for the expense incurred.</p>

<p>Every product contains two layers of superimposed utilities.
The one is begot of onerous toil and must be paid for. It constitutes
what we call value. The other, which is thrown into the bargain,
is a gift of nature, and as such is never paid for. This lower stratum,
though it is of considerable importance, is ignored simply because it
is not revealed in price. It is invisible because it is free.</p>

<p>But whenever a commodity is free, like air, light, or running
water, it is the common possession of everybody. The same idea
may be expressed by saying that below the apparent layer of value
which constitutes individual property there lies an invisible layer
of common property which benefits everybody alike. “What
Providence decreed should be common has remained so throughout
the whole history of human transactions.”</p>

<p>“This,” says Bastiat, “is the essential law of social harmony.”
The proprietor, who in the Ricardian theory figures as a kind of
dragon, jealously guarding the treasures of national wealth, which
can only be enjoyed on payment of a fine, or who in Proudhon’s
passionate invectives is denounced as an interceptor of the gifts of
God, appears to Bastiat as a mere intermediary between nature and
consumer. He is like a good servant who draws water from a
common fount, and receives payment, not for the water drawn, but
solely for the trouble of drawing it.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>But there is a still greater degree of harmony. Of the two
elements—the onerous and the gratuitous—which enter into the
composition of all forms of wealth, the former gradually tends to
lose its importance relatively to the latter. It is a general law of
industry that as invention progresses the human effort necessary to
obtain the same satisfaction diminishes. New labour is almost
always more productive than old, and this is true with regard to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
products, whether corn or coal, steel or cotton. It is true not only of
the products of the land, but also of the land itself. The cost of
clearing new land is diminishing, just as the expense of making new
machinery is decreasing. The natural utility, on the contrary, is
never diminished. Corn has to-day exactly the same utility as it
had on the morrow of the Deluge.</p>

<p>Property being nothing more than a sum of values, every
diminution of value must be interpreted as a constant restriction of
the rights of property.</p>

<p>Hence this result, “which reveals a most important fact for the
science, a fact, if I mistake not, as yet unperceived,”<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> namely,
that in every progressive society common or gratuitous utility never
stops growing, while the more arduous portion, which is usually
appropriated, gradually contracts. Present society is already
communistic, and is becoming more so every day.</p>

<p>The idea is indeed an attractive one. Individual property is like
a number of islands surrounded by a vast communal sea which is
continually rising, fretting their coasts and reducing their areas.
When labour has become all-powerful and when science has dispensed
with effort the last islet of property will sink beneath the wave of
free utility. And so Bastiat triumphantly exclaims: “You communists
dream of a future communism. Here you have the actual
thing. All utilities are freely given by the present social order
provided we facilitate exchange.”<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p>Bastiat, usually so logical, seems inclined to be sophistical here.
If we seek beneath this brilliant demonstration we shall merely find
the statement that rent is non-existent because the value of commodities—including
all natural products—can never exceed cost of
production. This cost of production is being continually lowered,
and so the value of goods must be falling.</p>

<p>But the statement requires proof. There is nothing to show how
the price of natural goods under the influence of competition would
tend to fall to the level of cost of production—still less to the
minimum level. There is no refutation either of the differential or
monopolistic theory of rent. There is doubtless this much truth in
it: nature does not create value, nor does it demand payment for
it. No one would to-day say that a single cent of the price of corn
or coal was meant as payment for the alimentary properties of the
one or the calorific capacity of the other. But although it is true
that nature asks nothing in return, it is not correct to say that the
landowner demands nothing except payment for trouble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
expenditure incurred. And this extra gain he never relinquishes
unless under pressure of competition. But this very seldom happens,
and economic theorists have to be content merely with showing how
the sale price usually exceeds the cost of production, and how this
excess is variously known as rent, profits, or surplus value.</p>

<p>Bastiat was fully conscious of the weakness of his argument.
He saw quite clearly that possession of a suitable piece of land in
the Champs-Élysées would earn something more than mere payment
for labour and outgoings. It is then that he takes refuge in his
theory of value, and attempts to show that the proprietor will never
draw more than the price of the service rendered. This may be
true. But the mere fact of possessing a natural source of wealth
permits of the raising of the price of these goods a great deal, and
then what becomes of community of interests, and of the theory
that the goods are handed on by the proprietor free of any charge?</p>

<p>How superior is Carey’s theory, both in its scientific value and in
its social import! Carey follows Ricardo step by step, whereas it
seems that Bastiat had only a very imperfect acquaintance with the
Ricardian theory.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> In reply to the statement that the value of corn
rises progressively because the more fertile lands are occupied first,
and the less fertile have to be utilised afterwards, Carey points out
that, on the contrary, cultivation begins with the poorer land first,
and that the richest is the last to be cultivated. The consequence
is just the reverse of what Ricardo predicted. As production
increases, the price of corn will be lowered. The process of reasoning
by which this reversal of the order of cultivation is demonstrated is
very interesting. The domestication of land, if the phrase be
permissible, like the utilisation of all natural forces, takes place
according to the inverted order of their strength. Animals are
domesticated before man harnesses wind or water, and water and
wind are employed before there is any thought of vapour or electricity.
The same is true of land. Fertile land in its natural state is either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
overrun with vegetation, which must be grubbed up, or is covered
with water, which must be drained off. “Rich land is the terror of
the emigrant.”<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> Its virgin forests must be felled, its wild animals
destroyed, its marshes drained, and its pestilential miasmas rendered
innocuous if it is not to become a mere graveyard. And not until
several generations have given of their toil will it be of much use.
Rather than undertake the task the earliest emigrant seeks the lighter
soils of the hill-side, which are better adapted to his feeble means, as
well as safer and more easily defended.</p>

<p>That this theory is well founded may be very clearly seen if we
watch the progress of cultivation or the colonisation of new lands,
or glance at the general history of civilisation. Men group themselves
in villages on the higher levels or build their castles on the
slopes of the hills, and only descend slowly and carefully into the
lower plains. How many are the localities in France where the new
town may be seen overspreading the plain close to the old city
which still crests the hill! The various national gods—Hercules,
for example, who stifled the hydra of Lerna in his arms and shot the
birds of Stymphalus’s pool with his arrows—are in all probability
just the men who first dared break up the alluvial soils.</p>

<p>This theory, again, is open to the same objection as Ricardo’s.
It applies to some cases only, and under certain conditions. Ricardo’s
theory explained the facts relative to England, where population
presses heavily upon the limited area of a small island already
well occupied. Carey’s theory is equally well adapted to an
immense continent, with a thinly scattered population, occupying
only a few cultivated islets amid the vast ocean of virgin forest
and prairie. The two theories are not contradictory. They apply
to two different sets of conditions, or to successive phases of economic
evolution. And seeing that Ricardo’s applies to the more advanced
stage of civilisation, it certainly ought to have the last word. If
Carey were writing now he would probably express himself somewhat
differently, for it is no longer true even of the United States that
the more fertile lands are still awaiting cultivation. Only the poorer
and the more arid plains remain uncultivated, and here dry farming
has to be resorted to. So that even in the “Far West” Ricardo’s theory
is closer to the facts than Carey’s. Rents are rising everywhere,
and not a few American millionaires owe their fortunes to this fact.<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>It is just possible that Bastiat had some knowledge of Carey’s
theory, for the theory is outlined in <i>The Past, the Present, and the
Future</i>, published by Carey a little before Bastiat’s death, as well as
in his <i>Social Science</i>, which appeared ten years later. At any rate,
let us render thanks to both of them for the suggestive thought that
as human power over nature increases, effort, difficulty, and value,
which is the outcome of difficulty, will disappear, and that, consequently,
the sum total of real wealth at the disposal of everyone will
increase, but that the poor will be those who will benefit most.<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading44">III: THE RELATION OF PROFITS TO WAGES</h4>

<p>The law of rent was not the only discordant note. That other law
which stated that profits vary inversely with wages was also
dissonant and needed refuting. Bastiat emphasises the contrast
between it and his new law of harmony, according to which the
interests of capital and labour are one, their respective shares
increase together, and the proportion given to labour grows more
rapidly even than capital’s.<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>That is the conclusion which Bastiat wishes to illustrate by
means of the following table:</p>

<table summary="Bastiat's figures">

</table>

<p>This law he speaks of as “the great, admirable, comforting,
necessary, and inflexible law of capital.”</p>

<p>The proof is very simple—too simple, perhaps. It rests entirely
upon the law concerning the lowering of the rate of interest, noted
by Turgot and other economists long before Bastiat’s time. If
capital, instead of asking 5 per cent., only demands 3 per cent., then
its share is diminished, and any further diminution of its share
must mean an increase of the proportion available for labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>But a <i>relative</i> diminution of this kind will not prevent capital
drawing an <i>absolutely</i> greater share, provided the total produce goes
on increasing, as is the case in every progressive community. Its
total share, though on the increase, may be decreasing relatively to
the share which goes to labour. For example, the total product
may be tripled, capital’s share having doubled in the meantime,
while labour’s portion is quadrupled. Unfortunately this is a
purely sophistical argument. The figures given in the table are
simply invented to meet the needs of the case. Even the universality
of the law concerning the lowering of the rate of interest is open to
dispute. Economic history seems to point to a series of periodic
oscillations of the rate, and quite recently it has risen very considerably.</p>

<p>The so-called “law” becomes more than doubtful if, following
Bastiat, we include under the term interest, not merely net interest,
but also profits and dividends and all kinds of returns from capital.</p>

<p>But, even admitting that such a law is thoroughly established,
does that prove that capital’s share is decreasing? A lowering of
the rate of interest cannot affect the capital already invested in
factories, mines, railways, State funds, etc. The latter will not draw
a penny less, and a fall in the rate of interest will increase the value
of all old capital. Every capitalist knows this and speculates on
the chance of its happening.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>Only in the case of new capital, then, will a lower rate of interest
reduce the capitalist’s share. If by any chance this new capital
should prove less productive than the old it may then happen that
the reduced rate of interest will mean an equal or even a greater
rise in the remuneration of labour. This is quite a probable
contingency, and the proof advanced by economists who believe in
a gradual lowering of the rate of interest is just this very fact that
new capital is generally less productive than old.</p>

<p>In short, the problem presented by the rate of interest, implying
as it does a certain connection between the value of the capital and
the value of the revenue, is entirely different from the question as to
what share of the produce will eventually fall to the lot of the
capitalist and what to the workers.<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only is the demonstration which Bastiat thought he had
given false, but the thesis itself is very doubtful when tested by the
facts. Statistics seem to show quite clearly—Bastiat’s law notwithstanding,
and not depreciating the influence of other powerful
factors, such as trade unions, strikes, and State intervention—that
during the course of the nineteenth century the share of the social
revenue which falls to the lot of capital has increased more rapidly
than labour’s.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading45">IV: THE SUBORDINATION OF PRODUCER
TO CONSUMER</h4>

<p>Bastiat laid considerable stress upon this principle, but it is not
easy to realise its harmonic significance.</p>

<p>The subordination of producer to consumer is nothing less than
the subordination of private to general interest. Producers always
consult their own interests, and are continually in search of profits.
Still, everything invented with a view to increasing profits results in
lowering prices, so that the consumer is the person who finally
benefits by it.<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> And so economic laws, the law of competition and
of value, constrain the producer who really wishes to be selfish to
be altruistic, even despite himself. The laws outwit him, but his
undoing benefits everyone else. While working for a maximum
profit he is really toiling to satisfy the needs of others in the most
economical fashion, and therein lies the harmony.</p>

<p>In all difficult economic problems the criterion should be this:
What solution will prove most advantageous to consumers? Never
ought we ask what will be most profitable for producers, although,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
unfortunately, this is the more usual question. In matters of
international trade, when the interest of the producer is uppermost,
Protection is established. If we only consulted the interest of
consumers, Free Trade would become an immediate necessity. Or
take the case of public or private expenditure. The producer can
bring himself to excuse or even to approve of breaking windows or
wasting powder,<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> but the consumer unceremoniously condemns all
such destruction of wealth as useless consumption.</p>

<p>But Bastiat is not content with giving the consumer mere
economic pre-eminence. He is equally anxious to demonstrate his
moral superiority. “If humanity is to be perfected, it must be by
the conversion of consumers, and not by the moralising of producers,”<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>
and so, he holds consumers responsible for the production
of unnecessary or worthless commodities, such as alcohol.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Bastiat’s
contribution to this subject is quite first-class, and may possibly be
his best claim to a place among the great economists. He was not
far wrong when on his death-bed he delivered to his disciples as his
last instructions—his <i>novissima verba</i>, “Political economy should
be studied from the consumer’s standpoint.” This distinguishes
him from his famous antagonist, Proudhon, who always had the
producer’s interest at heart.</p>

<p>The only things with which we can reproach Bastiat are a too
persistent faith in natural harmonies and a belief in the efficacy of
ordinary economic laws to bring about the supremacy of the consumer.
In fact, the consumer’s reign has not yet come, and the
economic mechanism is becoming more and more the tool of the
profit-maker. The consumer has had to seek in organisation a
method of defending his own interests and those of the public, with
whose interests his own are often confused. This is why we have
institutions like the co-operative society and the consumers’ league.
His moralisation, moreover, is not entirely his own affair. Before
the consumer realises the full measure of his responsibility and the
extent of his duties a great deal of work will be necessary on the
part of buyers’ social leagues, temperance leagues, etc.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, economists of the Liberal Individualist school
view such institutions with a somewhat critical eye.<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="heading46">V: THE LAW OF SOLIDARITY</h4>

<p>We must not forget, as most writers on the subject seem to have
done, that Bastiat was the first to give the law of solidarity—so
popular in the economics of to-day—a position of honour within the
science of political economy.<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> One of the unfinished chapters of
the <i>Harmonies</i>, entitled “Solidarity,” was meant to expound the
thesis that “society is just a collection of solidarities woven
together.”<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>The name is deceptive, however, and his conception of solidarity
is quite different from the one current to-day, while the conclusions
drawn are by no means similar.</p>

<p>The fundamental doctrine upon which the Solidarists of to-day
would base a new morality is briefly this: Every individual owes all
the good with which he is endowed, and all the evil with which he
is encumbered, to others. So whether he is wealthy or poor, virtuous
or vicious, it is his duty to share with those who are worse off, and he
has a right to demand a share from those who are better off. Only
in this way can we justify legal assistance, insurance, Factory Acts,
education, and taxation. The doctrine is a negation, or at the very
least a modification, of the strict principle of individual responsibility.</p>

<p>But Bastiat views it differently. He has no desire to weaken
individual responsibility, for responsibility must be the indispensable
corrective of liberty. And solidarity, because of the feeling of
interdependence to which it gives rise, is so bewildering that Bastiat
anxiously asks whether solidarity is actually necessary “in order to
hasten or to secure the just retribution of deeds done.” A closer
survey reconciles him to the prospect, for he sees in it a means of
extending and deepening individual responsibility. Seeing that the
results of good and bad deeds react upon everyone, everybody must
be interested in furthering every good deed and in repressing the bad,
especially since every deed reacts upon its author with its original
force multiplied a thousand, and perhaps a million times.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
harmony just consists in that. Bastiat’s solidarity aims, not at the
development of fraternity, but at the strengthening of justice. It
does not urge upon society the duty of permitting no differences
among its members, but it does emphasise the importance of handling
the scourge or bestowing the palm with greater impartiality. And
Bastiat, despite his law of solidarity—nay, possibly <i>because</i> of that
very law—definitely rejects all legal assistance, even in the case of
deserted children! National insurance, old age pensions, profit-sharing,
free education, everything that is comprised under the term
“social solidarity” is cast aside.<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>It is a terribly individualistic conception of solidarity. Comparison
with Carey’s ideas is again interesting. Carey may seem to
ignore it altogether, inasmuch as he never mentions the name. But
if the name was unknown to him he gave a good description of the
principle itself when he referred to it as “the power of association.”
And he was also probably the first to put the double character of
solidarity, as we know it to-day, in a clear light:</p>

<p>(1) As the differences among mankind increase in number and
intensity the more perfect will solidarity become.</p>

<p>(2) Individuality, instead of being weakened by it, is strengthened
and intensified.<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>Someone may perhaps point out that in our treatment of the
Optimists’ attack upon the great Classical laws no mention has been
made of that terribly discordant theme, Malthus’s law of population,
which ascribes all vice and misery to the operation of a natural
instinct. On this particular point Bastiat’s treatment is lacking in
both vigour and originality. His reply merely amounts to showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
that the preventive obstacles, such as shame and continence, religious
feeling and the desire for equality, all of which limit the number of
children, are equally <i>natural</i>, so that nature has placed a remedy
alongside of the evil.</p>

<p>A more solid argument, borrowed from Carey, attempts to show
how a growing density of population allows of a growth of production,
so that the production of commodities may develop <i>pari passu</i> with
the growth of population, or may even exceed it. Carey relied
upon his own observations. All over the vast American continent,
especially on the immense plains of the Mississippi, he noticed that
the few encampments of the poor tribes that dwelt there were being
rapidly replaced by large industrial centres. Such an increase of
population in immediate contiguity naturally resulted in a great
amassing of wealth.</p>

<p>We have already noted the fact that the growth of wealth in the
United States has outstripped the increase in its population. The
simultaneous development of Germany, both in numbers and wealth,
is still more striking.</p>

<p>But Carey’s population theory is open to the same criticism as
was urged against his theory of rent. Up to a certain degree of
density it is undoubtedly true, but there is no ground for believing
that it holds good beyond this.</p>

<p class="tb">Bastiat’s name is frequently linked with Dunoyer’s, to whom we
have already had occasion to refer.<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> Dunoyer was one of the most
militant of the politico-economic Liberals, and fully shared their
belief that free competition was a sufficient solution for every social
problem.<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> The obvious drawbacks of free competition, he thought,
were due to its imperfect character. No one was more opposed to
State Socialism and to intervention of every kind. He was opposed
to labour legislation, to Protection, to the regulation of the rights
of property, and even to the State management of forests. As we
have already remarked, he was against every kind of combination,
because it stood as an obstacle in the path of free competition.</p>

<p>Logically enough he was in favour of the free disposal of land,
and would not even make any reservations in favour of heirs. He
refuses to recognise the right of entail because the exercise of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
testator’s liberty necessarily involves the curtailment of the liberty
of his successors.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>Some of the arguments which he employs in support of free
exchange are quite novel. The following is one of the most interesting.
Admitting that it is not to the advantage of a poor country
to trade with another which is wealthier or industrially superior, the
same thing must apply to the poorer districts of a country in their
dealings with other provinces that have suddenly become rich, or
with rich provinces recently acquired by conquest. But “as soon
as they are annexed their superiority presumably disappears.” The
argument is amusing, but not very solid. It is not impossible that
free exchange, even within the bounds of the same country, may have
the effect of drawing capital and labour from the poorer districts
towards the richer, from Creuse or Corsica to Paris. This is just
what does happen. It is not, perhaps, a very serious evil, because
what France loses on the one hand she gains on the other; but if
Creuse or Corsica were independent states, anxious to preserve their
individuality, we could understand their taking measures to prevent
this drainage. It is true that it is not easy to see how protective
rights could accomplish this—a point which Dunoyer might well have
emphasised.</p>

<p>We cannot speak of Dunoyer without saying a word about his
theory of production. Labour with him is everything. Nature and
raw material are nothing. He stands at the opposite pole to the
Physiocrats,<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> and supplied a handle to those socialists who before
Marx’s day had thought that labour was the only source of wealth,
and that consequently all wealth should belong to the worker. But
he pays no very great attention to this idea. His chief concern is
with production, and not with distribution.</p>

<p>From this view of production he draws several interesting
conclusions.</p>

<p>In the first place, it matters little to him whether labour is applied
to material objects or not. That makes no difference, so far as its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
character or productivity is concerned, for in both cases what is
produced is an immaterial thing called utility. What the baker
produces is not bread, but the wherewithal to satisfy a certain
desire. This is exactly what the <i>prima donna</i> produces. The so-called
liberal professions are placed in the same category as manual
work, and in this respect again Dunoyer takes up a position opposed
to that of the Physiocrats.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>Contrary to what might have been expected, this large extension
of the concept production fails to include commerce. Dunoyer
applies the title productive to the singer, but refuses it to the
merchant, and by this strange reversal he arrives once again at the
Physiocratic position. Exchange is not productive<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> because buying
and selling does not involve any work, and where there is no work
there is no production. Exchange creates utilities, and it is not
easy to understand what more Dunoyer expects from it, seeing he
admits that labour can do nothing more. Exchange, he thought,
was a purely legal transaction, and he was loath to admit that any
act of a “corporate will” without labour or physical effort could
create wealth, just as the Physiocrats found it impossible to think of
wealth other than as a product of the soil.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II_THE_APOGEE_AND_DECLINE_OF">CHAPTER II: THE APOGEE AND DECLINE OF
THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL. JOHN STUART MILL</h3>

<p>While the French economists, alarmed at the consequences
involved in the theories of Malthus and Ricardo, strove to transmute
the Brazen laws into Golden ones, the English economists pursued
their wonted tasks, never once troubled by the thought that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
were possibly forging a weapon for their own destruction at the
hands of socialists.</p>

<p>The thirty years which separate the publication of Ricardo’s
<i>Principles of Political Economy</i> (1817) from Mill’s book bearing the
same title are occupied by economists of the second rank, who
apply themselves, not to the discovery of new principles, but to the
development and co-ordination of those already formulated. Of
course we must not lose sight of the mass of critical work bearing
upon certain aspects of current doctrines, which was produced by
English economists just about this time. But their ideas attracted
as little attention as did Cournot’s in France or Gossen’s in
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>These were the days when Miss Martineau and Mrs. Marcet gave
expositions of political economy in the form of tales, or conversations
with “young Caroline,”<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> when MacWickar, writing his <i>First
Lessons in Political Economy for the use of Elementary Schools</i>,
expressed the belief that the science was already complete. “The
first principles of political economy,” he wrote, “are mere truisms
which children might well understand, and which they ought to be
taught. A hundred years ago only savants could fathom them.
To-day they are the commonplaces of the nursery, and the only real
difficulty is their too great simplicity.”<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p>We cannot attempt the individual study of all the economists of
this period.<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> However, one of them, Nassau Senior,<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> certainly
deserves more space than we can give him in this history, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
perhaps the best representative of the Classical school, showing its
good and bad points better than any other writer. He removed
from political economy every trace of system, every suggestion of
social reform, every connection with a moral or conscious order,
reducing it to a small number of essential, unchangeable principles.
Four propositions seemed sufficient for this new Euclid,<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
all necessary corollaries being easily deducible from one or other of
these. Senior’s ambition was to make an exact science of it,
and he deserves to be remembered as one of the founders of pure
economics.</p>

<p>He is responsible for the introduction into political economy of
a new and hitherto neglected element, namely, an analysis of
abstinence or saving. (The former word, which is Senior’s choice,
is the more striking and precise term.) It is true enough, as
Senior remarks, that abstinence does not create wealth, but it
constitutes a title to wealth, because it involves sacrifice and pain
just as labour does. Hitherto the income of capital had been the
least defensible of all revenues, for Ricardo had only discussed it
incidentally, and had represented it as a surplus left over after
paying wages. The claim of capital was believed to be as evident
as that of land or labour, and there was no need for any further
inquiry. But has it any real right to separate remuneration, seeing
that, unlike the other two agents, it is itself a product of those two
and not an original factor of production? Here at last is its title,
not in labour, but in abstinence.</p>

<p>But if on the one hand Senior succeeds in establishing the claim
of interest, he invalidates the claim of most other capital revenues
on the other. Let us follow his argument. Cost of production is
made up of two elements, labour and abstinence, and wherever free
competition obtains, the value of the products is reduced to this
minimum. Where competition is imperfect, where there is a greater
or less degree of monopoly, then between cost of production and
value lies a margin which constitutes extra income for those who
profit by it. This revenue by definition of labour and abstinence is
independent of every sacrifice or personal effort. This revenue
Senior calls rent, and his theory is thus a mere extension of the
Ricardian. Rent is not the result of appropriating the better
situated or the more fertile lands only. It may be due to the appropriation
of some natural agent or to the possession of some personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
quality such as the artiste’s voice or the surgeon’s skill,<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> or it may
simply be the result of social causes or fortuitous circumstances.
Senior shows that rent, far from being an exceptional phenomenon,
is really quite normal. This kind of revenue which is wanting in
title—drawn, but not earned—is extremely important, and absorbs
a great share of the total wealth. Indeed, Senior goes much further,
and states that whenever, as in the case of death, capital passes from
the hands of those who have earned it into the possession of others,
it immediately becomes rent. The inheritor cannot plead abstinence—the
virtue is not transmissible, and he has no title to his fortune
except just good luck.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>No revolutionary socialist could ever have invented a better
argument for the abolition of the existing order. And how different
from the “natural order”! But Senior is quite unmoved, and the
superb indifference with which economists of the Ricardian school
affirm their belief in their doctrines without taking any account of
the consequences which might uphold or might destroy those very
beliefs has a peculiar scientific fascination for us.</p>

<p>Also, it was Senior who laid stress upon scarcity as the basis of
economic value. But a thing to possess value must be not merely
rare, it must also satisfy some want. It must be a rare utility. It
is the same term, “scarcity,” that was employed by Walras.</p>

<p>The Classical doctrines were taught during the first half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
nineteenth century, not in England alone, but in every country of
the world. In Germany they were expounded by von Thünen, of
whom we have already spoken, and by his contemporary Rau.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> In
France, despite the growing influence of the optimistic politico-liberal
creed considered in our last chapter, English Classical
economics was still taught by a large number of economists, among
whom Rossi deserves special mention. His <i>Cours d’Économie
politique</i>, published in 1840, enjoyed a fair success, due, not to any
originality in the contribution itself, but to the somewhat oratorical
style of the work.<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>But to proceed to the central figure of this chapter—John Stuart
Mill.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> With him Classical economics may be said in some way
to have attained its perfection, and with him begins its decay. The
middle of the nineteenth century marks the crest of the wave.
What makes his personality so attractive is his almost dramatic
appearance, and the consciousness that he was placed between two
schools, even between two worlds. To the one he was linked by
the paternal ties which bound him to the Utilitarian school, wherein
he was nurtured; the other beckoned him towards the new horizons
that were already outlined by Saint-Simon and Auguste Comte.
During the first half of his life he was a stern individualist; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
second found him inclined to socialism, though he still retained his
faith in liberty. His writings are full of contradictions; of sudden,
complete changes, such as the well-known <i>volte-face</i> on the wages
question. Mill’s book exhibits the Classical doctrines in their final
crystalline form, but already they were showing signs of dissolving
in the new current.</p>

<p>Like other theorists of the “Pure” school, he declared that there
was no room in political economy for the comparative judgment of
the moralist, but it was he also who wrote: “If, therefore, the
choice were to be made between communism with all its chances
and the present state of society with all its sufferings and injustices;
if the institution of private property necessarily carried with it as
a consequence that the produce of labour should be apportioned as
we now see it, almost in an inverse ratio to the labour—the largest
portions to those who have never worked at all, the next largest to
those whose work is almost nominal, and so in a descending scale, the
remuneration dwindling as the work grows harder and more disagreeable,
until the most fatiguing and exhausting bodily labour
cannot count with certainty on being able to earn even the necessaries
of life; if this or communism were the alternative, all the difficulties,
great or small, of communism, would be but as dust in the balance.”<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>It was Mill the utilitarian philosopher who declared that a
person of strong conviction “is a social power equal to ninety-nine
who have only interests.” It was he also who wrote that “competition
may not be the best conceivable stimulus, but it is at present
a necessary one, and no one can foresee the time when it will not be
indispensable to progress.” But he also admits that “co-operation is
the noblest ideal,” and that it “transforms human life from a conflict
of classes struggling for opposite interests to a friendly rivalry
in the pursuit of a good common to all.”<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>Mill, it has been said, was simply a gifted popular writer. But
this is to under-estimate his ability. It is true that, unlike Ricardo,
Malthus, or Say, his name is not associated with any economic law,
but he opened up a wider prospect for the science which will
secure him a reputation long after the demise of these so-called laws.
His fame is doubly assured, for in no other work on political
economy, not excepting even the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, are there so
many pages of fine writing, so many unforgettable formulæ which
will always be repeated by everyone who has to teach the science.
It is not for nought that the <i>Principles</i> has served as a text-book for
half a century in most of the English universities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Before examining the changes in the Classical doctrines which
Mill himself effected, we must give a brief outline of those theories as
they appeared in all their inflexible majesty towards the middle of
the nineteenth century, during the period between the publication
of the <i>Principles</i> and the death of John Stuart Mill, between 1848 and
1873. This was the period when the Classical Liberal school believed
that its two old rivals, Protectionism and socialism, were definitely
crushed. Reybaud, in his article on socialism in the <i>Dictionnaire
d’Économie politique</i> of 1852, wrote as follows: “To speak of
socialism to-day is to deliver a funeral oration.” Protection had
just been vanquished in the struggle that led to the repeal of the
English Corn Laws, and was to suffer a further check, alike in France
and in the other countries of Europe, as a result of the treaties of
1860. The future lay with the Classics. It was little thought that
1867 would witness the publication of <i>Kapital</i>, that in 1872 the
Congress of Eisenach would reassemble, when the treaties of 1860
would be publicly denounced.</p>

<p>Let us profit by its hour of glorious existence to give an exposition
of the doctrines which it taught. The treatment must necessarily be
very summary, seeing that we are not writing a treatise on political
economy, and that our attention must be confined to writers who
are definitively members of the Liberal school.</p>

<h4 id="heading47">I: THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS</h4>

<p>A belief in natural laws was always an article of faith with the
Classical school. Without some such postulate it seemed to them
that no collection of truths, however well attested, could ever lay
claim to the title of science. But these natural laws had none of
that “providential,” “finalistic,” and “normative” character so
frequently dwelt upon by the Physiocrats<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> and the Optimists. They
are simply natural laws like those of the physical order, and are
clearly non-moral. They may prove useful or they may be harmful,
and men must adapt themselves to them as best they can. To say
that political economy is a “dismal science” because it shows that
certain laws may have unfortunate results is as absurd as it would
be to call physics a “dismal science” because lightning kills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Far from being irreconcilable with individual liberty, these laws
are among its direct results. They are the spontaneous links which
bind together all free men. Freedom is always subject to conditions.
Men are not free in the matter of eating or not eating, and if they
would eat they <i>must</i> cultivate the soil. Freedom is limited not only
by the actions of other human beings, but also by the laws of the
physical world which surrounds us.</p>

<p>These laws are universal and permanent, for the elementary
needs of mankind are always and everywhere the same. Economics
is in quest of such permanent laws, and has no concern with the
merely temporary. It is only by seeking the more general and
consequently the more nearly universal laws that economics can
apprehend truth or hope to become a science. It must study man,
not men—the type, not the individual—the <i>homo œconomicus</i>
stripped of every attribute except self-interest. It does not deny
the existence of other qualities, but merely relegates them to the
consideration of other sciences.</p>

<p>It now remains to see what those natural laws were.</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Law of Self-interest.</i> This law has since been named the
Hedonistic principle—a term that was never employed by the
Classical school. Every individual desires well-being, and so would
be possessed of wealth. Similarly he would, if possible, avoid evil
and escape effort. This is a simple psychological law. Could
anything be more universal or permanent than this law, which is
simply the most natural and the most rational (using the term in its
Physiocratic sense) statement of the law of self-preservation? In
virtue of this fundamental principle the Classical school is frequently
known as the Individualist school.</p>

<p>But individualism need imply neither egoism nor egotism. This
confusion, which is repeatedly made with a view to discrediting the
Classical writers, is simply futile. No one has displayed greater
vigour in protesting against this method of treating individualism
than Stuart Mill. To say that a person is seeking his own good
is not to imply that he desires the failure of others. Individualism
does not exclude sympathy,<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> and a normal individual feels it a
source of gratification whenever he can give pleasure to others.</p>

<p>But this did not prevent Ricardo and Malthus showing the
numerous instances in which individual interests conflict, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
it is necessary that one interest should be sacrificed to another.
And Mill, far from denying the existence of these conflicts, has taken
special pains to emphasise them. The Classical writers, together
with the Optimists, reply that such contradictions are apparent only,
and that beneath these appearances there is harmony; or they
point out that these antinomies are due to the fact that both
individualism and liberty are only imperfectly realised, and as yet
not even completely understood, but that as soon as they are securely
established the evils which they have momentarily created will be
finally healed.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> Liberty is like Achilles’ lance, healing the wounds
it inflicts. Other individualists, such as Herbert Spencer, declare
that the conflict of individual interests is not merely advantageous
to the general interests of society, but is the very condition of
progress, weeding out the incapable to make room for the fittest.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Law of Free Competition.</i> Admitting that each individual
is the best judge of his own interests, then it is clearly the wisest
plan to let everyone choose his own path. Individualism presupposes
liberty, and the Individualist school is also known as the
Liberal school. This second title is more exact than the first, and
is the only one which the French school will accept. It emphatically
repudiates every other, whether Individualist, Orthodox, or Classical.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>The English school is equally decisive in its preference for
“Liberalism.” The terms “Manchesterism” and “Manchesterthum”
have also been employed, especially by German critics, in
describing this feature of their teaching.</p>

<p>But the Classical school itself thought of <i>laissez-faire</i> neither as
a dogma nor a scientific axiom. It was treated merely as a practical
rule which it was wise to follow, not in every case, but wherever a
better had not been discovered. Those who act upon it, in Stuart
Mill’s opinion, are nearer the truth nineteen times out of twenty than
those who deny it.<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> This practical Liberalism is intended to apply
to every aspect of economic life, and their programme includes
liberty to choose one’s employment, free competition, free trade
beyond as well as within the frontiers of a single country, free banks,
and a competitive rate of interest; and on the negative side it
implies resistance to all State intervention wherever the necessity
for it cannot be clearly demonstrated, as in the case of protective or
parental legislation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>In the opinion of Classical writers, free competition was the
sovereign natural law. It was sufficient for all things. It secured
cheapness for the consumer, and stimulated progress generally because
of the rivalry which it aroused among producers. Justice was
assured for all, and equality attained, for the constant pursuit of
profits merely resulted in reducing them to the level of cost of
production. The <i>Dictionnaire d’Économie politique</i> of 1852, which
may perhaps be considered as the code of Classic political economy,
expressed the opinion that competition is to the industrial world
what the sun is to the physical. And Stuart Mill himself, the author
of <i>Liberty</i>, no longer distinguishing between economic and political
liberty, in less poetic but equally conclusive terms states that “every
restriction of competition is an evil,” but that “every extension of it
is always an ultimate good.”<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> On this point he was a stern opponent
of socialism, although in other respects it possessed many attractions
for him. “I utterly dissent,” says he, “from the most conspicuous
and vehement part of their teaching, their declamations against
competition.”</p>

<p>But the Classical school, despite its glorification of free competition,
never had any intention of justifying the present <i>régime</i>.
The complaints urged against it on this score, like the similar charge
of egoism, are based upon a misconception. On the contrary, the
Classics, both new and old, complain of the imperfect character of
competition. Senior had already pointed out what an enormous
place monopoly still holds in the present <i>régime</i>. A <i>régime</i> of
absolutely free competition is as much a dream as socialism, and it
is as unjust to judge competition by the vices of the existing order
as it would be to judge of collectivism by what occurred in the
State arsenals.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Law of Population</i> also held an honourable place among
Classical doctrines, so honourable, indeed, that even the Optimists
never dared contradict it. And of all economists Mill seems most
obsessed by it.<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> In his dread of its dire consequences he surpasses
Malthus himself. And he reveals a far greater regard for moral
considerations than was ever shown by the latter. Mill was already
a Neo-Malthusian in the respect which he felt for the rights and
liberty of women, which are too seldom consulted when maternity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
is forced upon them.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> A numerous family appeared to him as
vicious and almost as disgusting as drunkenness.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> Time and again
he declares that the working classes can hope for no amelioration of
their lot unless they check the growth of population. One reason
for his favourable view of peasant proprietorship is the restraint
which it exercises upon the birth-rate. “The rate of increase of the
French population is the slowest in Europe,” he writes, and this
result he thought very encouraging.</p>

<p>To exorcise this terrible demon he would even sacrifice the
principle of liberty which everywhere else he is at so much pains to
defend. He was prepared to support a law to prohibit the marriage
of indigents,<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> a proposal to which Malthus was absolutely opposed.
His plea for this measure of restraint is expounded, not in the
<i>Principles</i>, but in another of his works entitled <i>Liberty</i>. It is, of
course, possible that <i>Liberty</i> may owe something to the collaboration
of Mrs. Stuart Mill.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Law of Demand and Supply</i>—the law that determines
the value of products and of productive services, such as labour,
land, and capital—is usually stated in the following terms: Price
varies directly with demand, inversely with supply. One of the
most important contributions which Mill made to the science was to
show that this apparently mathematically precise formula was
merely a vicious circle. If it be true that demand and supply cause
a variation of price, it is equally true that price causes a variation of
demand and supply. Mill corrects the dictum by saying that price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
is fixed at a margin where the quantity offered is equal to the
quantity demanded. All price variations move about this point,
just as the beam of a balance oscillates about a point of equilibrium.<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
He thus gave to the law of demand and supply a scientific precision
which it formerly lacked, and by substituting the conception of
equilibrium for the causal relation he introduced a new principle into
economics which was destined to lead to some important modifications.</p>

<p>The law of demand and supply explains the variations of value,
but fails to illuminate the conception of value itself. A more
fundamental cause must be sought, which can be found in cost of
production. Under a <i>régime</i> of free competition the fluctuations in
value tend toward this fixed point, just as “the sea tends to a level;
but it never is at one exact level.”<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>A temporary, unstable value dependent upon the variations of
demand and supply, a permanent, natural, or normal value regulated
by cost of production, such was the Classical law of value. Mill was
entirely satisfied with it, as will be seen from the following phrase,
which seems rather strange, coming from such a cautious philosopher.
“Happily,” says he, “there is nothing in the laws of value which
remains for the present or any future writer to clear up; the theory
of the subject is complete.”<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p>The law which regulates the value of goods applies also to the
value of money. Money also has a temporary value, determined by
the quantity in circulation and the demand for it for exchange
purposes—the celebrated quantity theory. But it also has a natural
value, determined by the cost of production of the precious metals.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The Law of Wages.</i> A similar law determined wages—the
price of hand-labour. Here again is a double law. Temporary
wages depend upon demand and supply—understanding by supply
the quantity of capital available for the upkeep of the workers, the
wages fund, and by demand the number of workers in search of
employment.<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> This law was more familiarly expressed by Cobden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
when he said that wages rose whenever two masters ran after the
same man, and fell whenever two men ran after the same master.</p>

<p>Natural or subsistence wages in the long run are determined by
the cost of production of labour—by the cost of rearing the worker.
The oscillations of temporary wages always tend to a position of
equilibrium about this point.</p>

<p>This “brazen law,” as Lassalle calls it, well deserves its title.
According to it wages depend entirely upon causes extraneous to the
worker, and bear no relation either to his need or to the character of
his work or his willingness to perform it. He is at the mercy of a
fatalistic law, and is as helpless to influence his market as a bale of
cotton. And not only is the law independent of him, but no intervention,
legal or otherwise, no institution, no system, can alter this
state of things without influencing one or other of the two terms of
the equation, the quantity of capital employed as wages—the wage
fund—or the numbers of the working population in search of work.
“Every plan of amelioration which is not founded upon this principle
is quite illusory.” Only by encouraging the growth of capital by
means of saving, or by discouraging the growth of population and
restraining the sexual instinct, can the terms of the equation be
favourably modified. Upon final analysis there are only two
chances of safety for the workers, and of these the first is beyond
their power,<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> while the second means the condemnation to celibacy
or onanism of all proletarians, as they are ironically called.</p>

<p>And thus Mill, who formulated the law with greater rigour than
any of his predecessors, found himself alarmed at its consequences.
He was specially impressed by the courageous but impotent efforts
of trade unionism, then at the beginning of its career. Mill and the
economists of the Liberal school were as strongly in favour of the
removal of the Combination Laws as they were persistent in their
demands for the repeal of the Corn Laws; but of what use was the
right of association and combination when a higher law frustrated
every attempt to raise wages? Just at this time Longe, writing in
1866, and Thornton, in his volume on <i>Labour</i>, began to question the
validity of the wage fund theory. They experienced no difficulty in
converting John Stuart Mill, who followed with his famous recantation
in the pages of the <i>Fortnightly</i>. His defection caused a remarkable
stir, and was thought almost an offence against the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
traditions of the Classical school. The conversion was not quite
complete, however, for the last edition of the <i>Principles</i> still contains
the passages we have already quoted, as well as others equally
discouraging to the working classes, and equally fatal to the hopes
which they had reasonably placed in their own efforts.<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>The wage fund theory, though badly shaken as a result of Mill’s
defection, was not abandoned by all the Classical writers, and some
recent American publications have attempted a revival of it.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

<p>(6) <i>The Law of Rent.</i> The law of competition tends to reduce
the selling price until it is equal to the cost of production. But
suppose, as is often the case, that there are two costs of production,
which of the two will determine the price? The higher will be the
determinant, and so there exists a margin for all similar products
whose cost of production is less. Ricardo showed that this was the
case with agricultural products as well as with certain manufactured
goods.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Mill included personal ability, and though the conception
of rent was thus very considerably extended, it had not the scope
which it had with Senior.</p>

<p>(7) <i>The Law of International Exchange.</i> According to the Liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
economists Ricardo and Dunoyer (see <a href="#Page_346">p. 346</a>), international trade is
subject to the laws regulating individual exchange, and the results
in the two cases are almost identical, namely, a saving of labour to
both parties. One party exchanges a product which has cost fifteen
hours’ labour for another which, had an attempt been made to
produce it directly, would have involved a labour of twenty hours.
The gain is credited to the importing side, for exportation is merely
the means whereby it is obtained. Its measure is the excess of the
imported value over the value exported.</p>

<p>It is clear that each party gains by the transaction. It is not
quite clear, nor is it altogether probable, that the advantages are
equally distributed. But it is generally believed that if any inequality
does exist the greater gain goes to the poorer country—to the one
that is less gifted by nature or less fitted for industrial life. The
latter country by very definition would experience great difficulty
in attempting the direct production of the imported goods, and would
even, perhaps, find it quite impossible. On this point the English
Classical or the Manchester school is in complete agreement with
the French school.<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>It might possibly be pointed out that under a <i>régime</i> of free
competition all values would be reduced to the level of cost of
production, and products would be exchanged in such a fashion
that a given quantity of labour embodied in one commodity would
always exchange for an equal quantity embodied in any other. But
in such a case where would be the advantage of exchanging?
Ricardo had already anticipated this objection, and had shown that
if the rule of equal quantity in exchange for equal quantity were
true of exchange between individuals, it did not hold of exchange
between different countries, for the equalising action of competition
no longer operated, because of the difficulty of moving capital and
labour from one to the other. A comparison should be made, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
of the respective costs of the same product in the two countries, but
of the respective costs of the imported and the exported products in
the same country. Another buttress to strengthen the theory
which measures the advantages of international commerce by the
amount of labour economised!<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>But the value of the exchanged product is still undetermined. It
lies somewhere between the real cost of production of the goods
exported and the virtual cost of production of the goods imported,
in such a way that each country gains something. That is all we
are able to say. Mill has gone a step farther. He has abandoned
the comparison of costs of production, which is purely abstract, and
can afford no practical measure of the advantages, preferring
to measure the value of the imported product by the value of the
product which must be given in exchange for it.<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> We require to
find the causes that enable a country like England to obtain a greater
or a lesser quantity of wine in exchange for her coal. In other words,
the law of international values no longer involves a comparison of
costs of production, but is simply the law of demand and supply.
The prices of the two goods arrange themselves in such a fashion
that the quantities demanded by the respective countries exactly
balance. If there is a greater demand for coal in France than there
is for wine in England, England will obtain a great quantity of wine
in exchange for her coal, and will consequently find herself in a very
advantageous position.</p>

<p>Mill’s theory<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> constitutes a real advance as compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Ricardo’s, for it affords a means of gauging the strength of the foreign
demand, and of judging of the circumstances favourable to a good
bargain. Mill was of the opinion that a poor country stood to benefit
most by the transaction—thus confirming Bastiat’s belief. A rich
country will always have to pay more for its goods than a poor one.<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>Protectionists affect the opposite belief, holding that it is the
poor country that is duped. The English trade with Portugal is
one of their favourite illustrations. But it is simply an illustration,
and it can never take the place of actual proof.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these divergent views, Mill is more sympathetic
to the Protectionists than any other economist of the Liberal school.
His theory provides them with at least one excellent argument.
Seeing that the advantages of international commerce depend upon
demand and supply, a country may make it operate to its own
advantage by merely pursuing a different policy. New industries
might be developed whenever there is a considerable demand for
new products, and that demand might easily be so considerable that
the price would be lowered.<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> Mill recognises the justice of merely
temporary protection, set up with a view to naturalising a new
industry, and considers it logically deducible from his principles.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>Although Mill may in this way have done something to lighten
the task of the Protectionists, we must never forget that he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
remained an entirely faithful adherent of the Free Trade doctrine
and, except in the case of infant industries, vigorously denounced
all protective rights. “All is sheer loss.… They prevent the
economy of labour and capital, thereby annihilating a general gain
to the world which would be shared in some proportion between
itself and other countries.”<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p>The Free Trade doctrine has not remained where it was any
more than the other special doctrines of the Classical school. It
gave birth to one of the most powerful movements in economic
history, which led to the famous law of June 25, 1846, abolishing
import duty on corn. This law was followed by others, and ended
in the complete removal of all tariff barriers. But the eloquence of
Cobden, of Bright, and of others was necessary before it was accomplished.
A national Anti-Corn League had to be organised, no less
than ten Parliamentary defeats had to be endured, the allegiance
of Peel and the approval of the Duke of Wellington had to be secured
before they were removed. All this even might have proved futile
but for the poor harvest of 1845. This glorious campaign did more
for the triumph of the Liberal economic school and for the dissemination
of its ideas than all the learned demonstrations of the masters.
Fourteen years were still to elapse before Cobden and Michel Chevalier
were able to sign the treaty of 1860. Even this was due to a
personal act of Napoleon III, and Cobden was not far wrong when
he declared that nine-tenths of the French nation was opposed to it.</p>

<h4 id="heading48">II: MILL’S INDIVIDUALIST-SOCIALIST PROGRAMME</h4>

<p>Such were the doctrines taught by the Classical school about the
middle of the nineteenth century. The writers in question, however,
strongly objected to the term “school,” believing that they themselves
were the sole guardians of the sacred truth. And we must
admit that their doctrines are admirably interwoven, and present an
attractive appearance. On the other hand, it must be confessed that
the prospects which they hold out for anyone not a member of the
landowning class are far from attractive. For the labourer there
is promise of daily toil and bare existence, and at best a wage
determined by the quantity of capital or the numbers of the
population—causes which are clearly beyond the workers’ influence,
and even beyond the assuaging influence of association and combination.
And although the latter rights are generously claimed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
workers, the occasional antagonism between masters and men
presages the eternal conflict between profits and wages. The
possession of land is a passport to the enjoyment of monopolistic
privileges, which the right of free exchange can only modify very
slightly. Rent—the resultant of all life’s favourable chances—reserved
for those who need it least, monopolises a growing proportion
of the national revenue. Intervention for the benefit of the
worker, whether undertaken by the State or by some other body, is
pushed aside as unworthy of the dignity of labour and harmful to
its true interests. “Each for himself” is set up as a principle of
social action, in the vain hope that it would be spontaneously
transformed into the principle of “Each for all.” The search for
truth was the dominant interest of the school, and these doctrines
were preached, not for the pleasure they yielded, but as the dicta of
exact science. Little wonder that men were prepared to fight before
they would recognise these as demonstrable truths. And just as it
was Mill who so powerfully helped to consolidate and complete the
science of economics that Cossa refers to his <i>Principles</i> as the best
<i>résumé</i>, the fullest, most complete and most exact exposition of the
doctrines of the Classical school that we have,<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> it was Mill also who,
in successive editions of his book, and in his other and later writings,
pointed out the new vistas opening before the science, freed the
doctrine from many errors to which it was attached and set its feet
on the paths of Liberal Socialism.</p>

<p>We might say without any suggestion of bias that Mill’s evolution
was largely influenced by French ideas.<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> A singularly interesting
volume might be written in illustration of this statement. Without
referring to the influence of Comte, which Mill was never tired of
recognising, and confining our attention only to economics, he has
himself acknowledged his debt to the Saint-Simonians for the greater
part of his doctrines of heredity and unearned increment, to Sismondi
for his sympathy with peasant proprietorship, and to the socialists
of 1848 for his faith in co-operative association as a substitute for the
wage nexus.</p>

<p>It would hardly be true to say that Mill became a convert to
socialism, although he showed himself anxious to defend it against
every undeserved attack. To those who credit socialism with a
desire to destroy personal initiative or to undermine individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
liberty he disdainfully points out that “a factory operative has less
personal interest in his work than a member of a communist association,
since he is not, like him, working for a partnership of which
he is himself a member,” and that “the restraints of communism
would be freedom in comparison with the present condition of the
majority of the human race.”<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> And although he expresses the
belief that “communism would even now be practicable among the
<i>élite</i> of mankind, and may become so among the rest,” and hopes that
one day education, habit, and culture will so alter the character of
mankind that digging and weaving for one’s country will be considered
as patriotic as to fight for it,<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> still he was far from being a socialist.
Free competition, he thought, was an absolute necessity, and there
could be no interference with the essential rights of the individual.</p>

<p>The first blow which he dealt at the Classical school was to
challenge its belief in the universality and permanence of natural
law. He never took up the extreme position of the Marxian and
Historical schools, which held that the so-called natural laws were
merely attempts at describing the social relations which may exist at
certain periods in economic history, but which change their character
as time goes on. He draws a distinction between the laws which
obtain in the realm of production and those that regulate distribution.
Only in the one case can we speak of “natural” laws; in the
other they are artificial—created by men—and capable of being
changed, should men desire it.<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> Contrary to the opinion of the
Classical school, he tries to show that wages, profits, and rent are
not determined by immutable laws against which the will of man
can never prevail.</p>

<p>The door was thus open for social reform, which was no small
triumph. Of course it cannot be said of the Classical school, or
even of the Optimists, that they were prepared to deny the possibility
or the efficacy of every measure of social reform, but it must be
admitted that they were loath to encourage anything beyond
private effort, or to advocate the abolition of any but the older
laws. Braun, speaking at a conference of Liberal economists at
Mayence in 1869, expressed the opinion that “that conference had
given rise to much opposition because it upheld the principle that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
human legislation can never change the eternal laws of nature,
which alone regulate every economic action.” Similar declarations
abound in the French works of the period. But, thanks to the
distinction drawn by Mill, all this was changed. Though the legislator
be helpless to modify the laws of production, he is all-powerful in the
realm of distribution, which is the real battle-ground of economics.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, Mill’s distinction is open to criticism,
especially his method of stating it; and we feel that he is unjust to
himself when he regards this as his most important and most
original contribution to economic science. Production and distribution
cannot be treated as two separate spheres, for the one
invariably involves the other. And Mill himself is forced to abandon
his own thesis when he advocates the establishment of co-operative
associations or peasant proprietorship, for each of these belongs as
much to the domain of production as to that of distribution.
Rodbertus, at almost the same period, gave a much truer expression
to Mill’s thought by emphasising the distinction which exists between
economic and legal ties.<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Even these may mutually involve one
another; still we know that the economic laws which regulate
exchange value or determine the magnitude of industrial enterprise
are not of the same kind as the rules of law which regulate the transfer
of property or lay down the lines of procedure for persons bound by
agreement concerning wages, interest, or rent. The first may well
be designated natural laws, but the latter are the work of a legislative
authority.</p>

<p>Stuart Mill, not content with merely opening the door to reform,
deliberately enters in, and, in striking contrast to the economists of
the older school, outlines a comprehensive programme of social
policy, which he formulates thus:<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> “How to unite the greatest
individual liberty of action, with a common ownership in the raw
material of the globe, and an equal participation of all in the
benefits of combined labour.”</p>

<p>We may summarise his proposals as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Abolition of the wage system and the substitution of a
co-operative association of producers.</p>

<p>(2) The socialisation of rent by means of a tax on land.</p>

<p>(3) Lessening of the inequalities of wealth by restrictions on the
rights of inheritance.</p>

<p>This threefold measure of reform possesses all the desiderata laid
down by Mill. Moreover, it does not conflict with the individualistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
principle, but would somewhat strengthen it. It involves no personal
constraint, but tends to extend the bounds of individual freedom.</p>

<p>Let us briefly review these projects <i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>(1) Mill thought that the wages <i>régime</i> was detrimental to
individuality because it deprived man of all interest in the product
of his labour, with the result that a vast majority of mankind is living
under conditions which socialism could not possibly make much worse.</p>

<p>It is necessary to replace this condition of things by “a form of
association which, if mankind continue to improve, must be expected
in the end to predominate, and is not that which can exist between a
capitalist as chief and workpeople without a voice in the management,
but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of
equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on
their operations, and working under managers elected and removable
by themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> This noble ideal of a co-operative community
was borrowed, not from Owen, but from the French socialists.
Mill had already eulogised the French movement, even before its
brilliant but ephemeral triumph in 1848. He was not the only one to
be attracted by the idea of a co-operative community, for the English
Christian Socialists drew their inspiration from the same source.</p>

<p>Mill lived long enough to witness the decline of co-operative
production in England, and of the Co-operative Consumers’ Union
in France, but neither failure seems to have had any influence upon
his projects.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> Whatever the method might be, the object in his
ideal was always the same, the self-emancipation of the workers.</p>

<p>(2) The rent of land, which Ricardo and his disciples accepted as
a natural if not as a necessary phenomenon, appeared to Mill as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
abnormal fact which was as detrimental to individuality as the
wage system itself. Its peculiar danger was, of course, not quite
the same. What rent did was to secure to certain individuals
something which was not the result of their own efforts, whereas
individualism always aimed at securing for everyone the fruits of his
own labour—<i>suum cuique</i>. On the principle of giving to each what
each produced, everything not directly produced by man himself
was to be restored to the community. It is immaterial whether
this extra product is due to the collaboration of nature, as Smith
and the Physiocrats believed, or whether it is the result of the
pressure of population, as Ricardo and Malthus thought, or the
mere result of chance and favourable circumstance, as Senior put it.
Nothing could be easier than to levy a land tax which would gradually
absorb rent, and which could be periodically increased as rents
advanced. The idea was a brilliant one, and Mill had learned it
from his father. It soon became the rallying-cry of a new school of
economists closely akin to the socialists.</p>

<p>The movement begot of this idea of confiscation deserves the
fuller treatment which will be found in another chapter of this work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, and until the larger and more revolutionary reform
becomes practical, Mill would welcome a modest instalment of
emancipation in the shape of peasant proprietorship. Like the
co-operative ideal, this also was of French extraction. Admiration
of the French peasant had been a fashionable cult in England ever
since the days of Arthur Young.<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> Mill thought that among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
principal advantages of peasant proprietorship would be a lessening
of the injustice of rent, because its benefits would be more widely
distributed. The feeling of independence would check the deterioration
of the wage-earner, individual initiative would be encouraged,
the intelligence of the cultivator developed, and the growth of population
checked.</p>

<p>Mill inspired a regard for the frugal French peasantry in the
English Radical party. To his influence are due the various Small
Holdings Acts which have resulted in the establishment of small islets
of peasant tillers amid the vast territories of the English aristocracy.</p>

<p>(3) Mill was equally shocked at our antiquated inheritance law,
which permits people to possess wealth which they have never helped
to produce. To Senior inheritance ranked with the inequality of
rent, and he placed both in the same category. To Mill it appeared
to be not merely antagonistic to individual liberty, but a source of
danger to free competition, because it placed competitors in positions
of unequal advantage. In this matter Mill was under the influence
of the Saint-Simonians, and he made no attempt to hide his contempt
for the “accident of birth.”</p>

<p>This right of bequest, he felt, was a very difficult problem, for
the right of free disposal of one’s property even after death constituted
one of the most glorious attributes of individuality. It
implied a kind of survival or persistence of the human will. Mill
showed considerable ingenuity in extricating himself from this
difficult position. He would respect the right of the proprietor to
dispose of his goods, but would limit the right of inheritance by
making it illegal to inherit more than a certain sum. The testator
would still enjoy the right of bequeathing his property as he wished,
but no one who already possessed a certain amount of wealth could
inherit it. Of all the solutions of this problem that have been
proposed, Mill’s is the most socialistic. He puts it forward, however,
not as a definite project, but as a mere suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>Mill might well have been given a place among the Pessimists,
especially as he inherits their tendency to see the darker side of
things. Not only did the law of population fill him with terror, but
the law of diminishing returns seemed to him the most important
proposition in the whole of economic science; and all his works
abound with melancholy reflections upon the futility of progress.
There is, for instance, the frequently quoted “It is questionable if
all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day’s
toil of any human being.”<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> In his vision of the future of society
he prophesies that the river of human life will eventually be lost in
the sea of stagnation.</p>

<p>It is worth while dwelling for a moment on this idea of a
stationary state. Though the conception is an old one, it is very
characteristic of Mill’s work, and he feels himself forced to the
belief that only by reverting to the stationary state can we hope for
a solution of the social question.</p>

<p>Economists, especially Ricardo, had insisted upon the tendency
of profits to a minimum as a correlative of the law of diminishing
returns. This tendency, it was believed, would continue until
profits had wholly disappeared and the formation of new capital
was arrested.<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Mill took up the theory where Ricardo had left it, and
arrived at the conclusion that industry would thus be brought to a
standstill, seeing that the magnitude of industry is dependent upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the amount of available capital. Population must then become
stationary, and all economic movement must cease. Though
alarmed at the economic significance of this prospect, Mill acquiesced
in its ethical import. On the whole he thinks that such a state
would be a very considerable improvement on our present condition.
With economic activity brought to a standstill the current of human
life would simply change its course and turn to other fields.<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> The
decay of Mammon-worship and the thirst for wealth would simply
mean an opportunity for pursuing worthier objects. He hoped that
the arrest of economic progress would result in a real moral advance,
and in the appeasement of human desires he looked for a solution
and for the final disappearance of the social problem. And as far
as we can see the reformers of to-day have nothing better to offer us.</p>

<h4 id="heading49">III: MILL’S SUCCESSORS</h4>

<p>Mill’s influence was universal, though, properly speaking, he had no
disciples. This was, no doubt, partly because writers like Toynbee,
who would naturally have become disciples, were already enrolled
in the service of the Historical school.</p>

<p>The Classical school failed to follow his socialistic lead. It still
preached the old doctrines, but with waning authority, and no new
work was produced which is at all comparable with the works which
we have already studied. We will mention a few of the later writings,
however, for, though belonging to the second class, they are in some
respects excellent.</p>

<p>In the first place we have several books written by Cairnes,<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
notably <i>Some Leading Principles of Political Economy</i> (1874). Cairnes
is generally regarded as a disciple of Mill, though as a matter of fact
he was nothing of the kind. Cairnes was purely Classic, and shared
the Classical preference for the deductive method, which he thought
the only method for political economy. His preference for that
method sometimes resulted in his abusing it, and he was curiously
indifferent to all social iniquities. He accepted <i>laissez-faire</i>, not as
the basis of a scientific doctrine, but simply as a safe and practical
rule of conduct.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> The old wage fund theory has in him a champion
who attempted to defend it against Stuart Mill. It cannot be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
that he made any new contribution to the science, unless we except
his teaching concerning competition. He pointed out that competition
has not the general scope that is usually attributed to it. It
only obtains between individuals placed in exactly similar circumstances.
In other words, it operates within small areas, and is
inoperative as between one area and another. This theory of non-competing
groups helps to throw some light upon the persistent
inequality shown by wages and profits.</p>

<p>In France the most prominent representative of political
economy during the Second Empire was Michel Chevalier, a disciple
of Saint-Simon. He nevertheless remained faithful to the Classical
tradition of Say and Rossi,<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> his predecessors at the Collège de France.
He waged battle with the socialists of 1848, made war upon Protection,
and had the good fortune to be victorious in both cases, sharing
with Cobden the honour of being a signatory to the famous commercial
treaty of 1860. He realised the important place that railways
would some day occupy in national economy, and the great
possibilities of an engineering feat like the Suez Canal. He was also
alive to the importance of credit institutions, which were only at the
commencement of their useful career just then.<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> Although connected
with the Liberal school, he was not indifferent to the teaching
of the Saint-Simonians on the importance of the authority and
functions of the State, and he impressed upon the Government the
necessity of paying attention to labour questions—a matter to which
Napoleon III was naturally somewhat averse. Every subject which
he handles is given scholarly and eloquent treatment.</p>

<p>About the same time Courcelle-Seneuil published a treatise on
political economy which was for a long time regarded as a standard
work. Seneuil was a champion of pure science—or “plutology,”
as he called it, in order to distinguish it from applied science, to
which he gave the name “ergonomy.” For a long time he was
regarded as a kind of pontiff, and the pages of the <i>Journal des Économistes</i>
bear evidence of the chastisement which he bestowed upon
any of the younger writers who tried to shake off his authority.
This was the time when Maurice Block was meting out the same
treatment to the new German school in those bitterly critical articles
which appeared in the same journal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be regretted that we cannot credit France with the <i>Précis
de la Science économique et de ses Principales Applications</i>, which
appeared in 1862. Cherbuliez, the author, was a Swiss, and was
professor first at Geneva and then at Zurich. Cossa, in his <i>Histoire</i>,
speaks of it as “undoubtedly the best treatise on the subject published
in France,” and as being “possibly superior even to Stuart Mill’s.”
Cherbuliez belonged to the Classical school. He was opposed to
socialism, and wrote pamphlets <i>à la</i> Bastiat in support of Liberal
doctrines and the deductive method. But, like the Mills before him,
and Walras, Spencer, Laveleye, Henry George, and many others
who came after, he found it hard to reconcile private property with
the individualistic doctrine, “To each the product of his labour.”
He reconciles himself to this position merely because he thinks that
it is possibly a lesser evil than collective property.</p>

<p>The Liberal school had still a few adherents in Germany, although
a serious rival was soon to make its appearance. Prince Smith (of
English extraction) undertook the defence of Free Trade, pointing out
“the absurdity of regarding it as a social question,” and “how much
more absurd it is to think that it can ever be solved other than by
the logic of facts.” Less a doctrinaire than a reformer, Schulze-Delitzsch,
about 1850, inaugurated that movement which, notwithstanding
the gibes of Lassalle, has made magnificent progress, and
to-day includes thousands of credit societies; though up to the
present it has not benefited anyone beyond the lower middle classes—the
small shopkeeper, the well-to-do artisan, and the peasant
proprietor.</p>

<h2 id="BOOK_IV_THE_DISSENTERS">BOOK IV: THE DISSENTERS</h2>

<p>With Bastiat economic Liberalism, threatened by socialism, sought
precarious refuge in Optimism. With Mill the older doctrines found
new expression in language scientific in its precision and classical
in its beauty.</p>

<p>It really seemed as if political economy had reached its final
stage and that there could be no further excuse for prolonging our
survey.</p>

<p>But just when Liberalism seemed most triumphant and the
principles of the science appeared definitely settled there sprang up
a feeling of general dissatisfaction. Criticism, which had suffered
a temporary check after 1848, now reasserted its claims, and with a
determination not to tolerate any further interruption of its task.</p>

<p>The reaction showed itself most prominently in Germany, where
the new Historical school refused to recognise the boundaries of the
science as laid down by the English and French economists. The
atmosphere of abstractions and generalisations to which they had
confined it was altogether too stifling. It demanded new contact
with life—with the life of the past no less than that of the present.
It was weary of the empty framework of general terms. It was
athirst for facts and the exercise of the powers of observation. With
all the ardour of youth it was prepared to challenge all the traditional
conclusions and to reformulate the science from its very base.</p>

<p>So much for the doctrine. But there was one thing which was
thought more objectionable than even the Classical doctrine itself,
and that was the Liberal policy with which the science had foolishly
become implicated, and which must certainly be removed.</p>

<p>In addition to such critics as the above there are also the writers
who drew their inspiration from Christianity, and in the name of
charity, of morality, or of religion itself, uttered their protest against
optimism and <i>laissez-faire</i>. Intervention again, so tentatively proposed
by Sismondi, makes a bold demand for wider scope in view
of the pressure of social problems, and under the name of State
Socialism becomes a definitely formulated doctrine.</p>

<p>Socialism, which Reybaud believed dead after 1848, revived in
its turn. Marx’s <i>Kapital</i>, published in 1867, is the completest and
most powerful exposition of socialism that we have. It is no
longer a pious aspiration, but a new and a scientific doctrine ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
to do battle with the champions of the Classical school, and to confute
them out of their own mouths.</p>

<p>None of these currents is entirely new. Book II has shown us
where they originated, and their beginnings can be traced to the
earlier critical writers.</p>

<p>But we must not forget the striking difference between the ill-fated
doctrines of the pre-1848 period and the striking success achieved
by the present school. Despite the sympathy shown for the earlier
critics, they remained on the whole somewhat isolated figures. Their
protests were always individualistic—Sismondi’s no less than Saint-Simon’s,
Fourier’s no less than Owen’s. Proudhon and List never
seriously shook the public confidence in Liberalism. Now, on the contrary,
Liberalism finds itself deserted, and sees the attention of public
opinion turning more and more in the direction of the new school.</p>

<p>The triumph, of course, was not immediate. Many of the doctrines
were formulated between 1850 and 1875, but victory was deferred
until the last quarter of the century. But when it did come it
was decisive. In Germany history monopolised the functions of economics,
at least for a time. Intervention has only become universal
since 1880. Since then, also, collectivism has won over the majority
of the workers in all industrial countries, and has exercised very
considerable influence upon politics, while Christian Socialism has
discovered a way of combining all its most fervent adherents, of
whatever persuasion, in one common faith.</p>

<p>The advance of this new school meant the decline of the Classical
doctrine and the waning of Liberalism. Public interest gravitated
away from the teaching of the founders. But in the absence of a new
and a definite creed, what we find is a kind of general dispersion of
economic thought, accompanied by a feeling of doubt as to the
validity of theory in general and of theoretical political economy in
particular. The old feeling of security gave place to uncertainty.
Instead of the comparative unanimity of the early days we have a
complete diversity of opinions, amid which the science sets out on a
new career.</p>

<p>In the last Book we shall find that certain eminent writers have
succeeded in renewing the scientific tradition of the founders. But
every connection with practical politics had to be removed and a
new body of closely knit doctrines had to be created before social
thinkers could have this new point of view from which to co-operate.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I_THE_HISTORICAL_SCHOOL_AND">CHAPTER I: THE HISTORICAL SCHOOL AND
THE CONFLICT OF METHODS</h3>

<p>The second half of the nineteenth century is dominated by Historical
ideas, though their final triumph was not fully established until
the last quarter of the century. The rise of these ideas, however,
belongs to a still earlier period, and dates from 1843, when there
appeared a small volume by Roscher entitled <i>Grundriss</i>. We shall
have to return to that date if we wish to understand the ideas of the
school and to appreciate their criticisms.</p>

<p>The successors of J. B. Say and Ricardo gave a new fillip to the
abstract tendency of the science by reducing its tenets to a small
number of theoretical propositions. The problems of international
exchange, of the rate of profits, wages, and rent, were treated simply
as a number of such propositions, expressed with almost mathematical
precision. Admitting their exactness, we must also recognise that
they are far from being adequate, and could not possibly afford an
explanation of the different varieties of economic phenomena or help
the solution of the many practical problems which the development
of industry presents to the statesman. But McCulloch, Senior,
Storch, Rau, Garnier,<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> and Rossi, the immediate successors of
Ricardo and Say in England and France, repeated the old formulæ
without making any important additions to them. The new
system of political economy thus consisted of a small number of
quite obvious truths, having only the remotest connection with
economic life. It is true that Mill is an exception. But the <i>Principles</i>
dates from 1848, which is subsequent to the foundation of the
Historical school. With this exception we may say, in the words of
Schmoller, that after the days of Adam Smith political economy
seems to have suffered from an attack of anæmia.<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p>Toynbee gives admirable expression to this belief in his article
on <i>Ricardo and the Old Political Economy</i>:<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> “A logical artifice
became the accepted picture of the real world. Not that Ricardo
himself, a benevolent and kind-hearted man, could have wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
or supposed, had he asked himself the question, that the world
of his treatise actually was the world he lived in; but he unconsciously
fell into the habit of regarding laws which were those
only of that society which he had created in his study for purposes
of analysis as applicable to the complex society really
existing around him. And the confusion was aggravated by some
of his followers and intensified in ignorant popular versions of
his doctrines.” In other words, there was a striking divergence
between economic theory and concrete economic reality, a divergence
that was becoming wider every day, as new problems arose
and new classes were being formed. But the extent of the gap was
best realised when an attempt was made to apply the principles of
the science to countries where the economic conditions were entirely
different from those existing either in England or in France.</p>

<p>This divergence between theory and reality might conceivably
be narrowed in one of two ways. A more harmonious and a more
comprehensive theory might be formulated, a task which Menger,
Jevons, and Walras attempted about 1870. A still more radical
suggestion was to get rid of all abstract theory altogether and to
confine the science to a simple description of economic phenomena.
This was the method of procedure that was attempted first, and it is
the one followed by the Historical school.</p>

<p>Long before this time certain writers had pointed out the dangers
of a too rigid adherence to abstraction. Sismondi—an essentially
historical writer—treated political economy as a branch of moral
science whose separation from the main trunk is only partial, and
insisted upon studying economic phenomena in connection with their
proper environment. He criticised the general conclusions of
Ricardo and pleaded for a closer observation of facts.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> List showed
himself a still more violent critic, and, not content with the condemnation
of Ricardian economics, he ventured to extend his strictures
even to Smith. Taking nationality for the basis of his system,
he applied the comparative method, upon which the Historical
school has so often insisted,<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> to the commercial policy of the Classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
school; but history was still employed merely for the purpose of
illustration. Finally, socialists, especially the Saint-Simonians, whose
entire system is simply one vast philosophy of history, had shown
the impossibility of isolating economic from political and juridical
phenomena, with which they are always intermingled.</p>

<p>But no author as yet had deliberately sought either in history or
in the observation of contemporary facts a means of reconstructing
the science as a whole. It is just here that the originality of the
German school lies.</p>

<p>Its work is at once critical and constructive. On the critical side
we have a profound and suggestive, though not always a just, analysis
of the principles and methods of the older economists, while its
constructive efforts gave new scope to the science, extended the
range of its observations, and added to the complexity of its problems.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it is not a difficult task to give an exposition
of the critical ideas of the school, as we find them set forth in several
books and articles, but it is by no means easy to delineate the conceptions
underlying the positive work. Though implicit in all their
writings, these conceptions are nowhere explicitly stated; whenever
they have tried to define them it has always been, as their disciples
willingly admit, in a vague and contradictory fashion.<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> To add further
to the difficulty, each author defines them after his own fashion, but
claims that his definition represents the ideas of the whole school.</p>

<p>In order to avoid useless repetitions and discussions without
number we shall begin with a rapid survey of the outward development
of the school, following with a <i>résumé</i> of its critical work,
attempting, finally, to seize hold of its conception of the nature and
object of political economy. From our point of view the last-named
object is by far the most interesting.</p>

<h4 id="heading50">I: THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT
OF THE HISTORICAL SCHOOL</h4>

<p>The honour of founding the school undoubtedly belongs to
Wilhelm Roscher, a Göttingen professor, who published a book
entitled <i>Grundriss zu Vorlesungen über die Staatswirtschaft nach
geschichtlicher Methode</i> in 1843. In the preface to that small volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
he mentions some of the leading ideas which inspired him to undertake
the work, which reached fruition in the celebrated <i>System der
Volkswirtschaft</i> (1st ed., 1854). He makes no pretence to anything
beyond a study of economic history. “Our aim,” says he,
“is simply to describe what people have wished for and felt in
matters economic, to describe the aims they have followed and the
successes they achieved—as well as to give the reasons why such
aims were chosen and such triumphs won. Such research can only
be accomplished if we keep in close touch with the other sciences of
national life, with legal and political history, as well as with the
history of civilisation.”<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> Almost in the same breath he justifies an
attack upon the Ricardian school. He recognises that he is far
from thinking that his is the only or even the quickest way of attaining
the truth, but thinks that it will lead into pleasant and fruitful
quests, which once undertaken will never be abandoned.</p>

<p>What Roscher proposed to do was to try to complete the
current theory by adding a study of contemporary facts and opinions,
and, as a matter of fact, in the series of volumes which constitute
the <i>System</i>, every instalment of which was received with growing
appreciation by the German world of letters, Roscher was merely
content to punctuate his exposition of the Classical doctrines with
many an erudite excursus in the domain of economic facts and ideas.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>Roscher referred to his experiment as an attempt to apply the
historical method which Savigny had been instrumental in introducing
with such fruitful results into the study of jurisprudence.<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
But, as Karl Menger<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> has well pointed out, the similarity is only
superficial. Savigny employed history in the hope of obtaining
some light upon the organic nature and the spontaneous origin of
existing institutions. His avowed object was to prove their legitimacy
despite the radical pretensions of the Rationalist reformers of
the eighteenth century. Roscher had no such aim in view. He
was himself a Liberal, and fully shared in their reforming zeal.
History with him served merely to illustrate theory, to supply
rules for the guidance of the statesman or to foster the growth of
what he called the political sense.</p>

<p>Schmoller thinks that Roscher’s work might justly be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
as an attempt to connect the teaching of political economy with
the “Cameralist” tradition of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> These Cameralists were engaged in teaching the principles
of administration and finance to students who were to spend their
lives in administrative work of one kind or another, and they naturally
took good care to keep as near actual facts as possible. Even in
England and France political economy soon got involved in certain
practical problems concerning taxation and commercial legislation.
But in a country like Germany, which was industrially much more
backward than either England or France, these problems wore a
very different aspect, and some correction of the Classical doctrines
was absolutely necessary if they were to bear any relation to the
realities of economic life. Roscher’s innovation was the outcome
of a pedagogic rather than of a purely scientific demand, and he was
instrumental in reviving a university tradition rather than in creating
a new scientific movement.</p>

<p>In 1848 another German professor, Bruno Hildebrand, put
forward a much more ambitious programme, and his <i>Die Nationalökonomie
der Gegenwart und Zukunft</i> shows a much more fundamental
opposition to the Classical school. History, he thought, would not
merely vitalise and perfect the science, but might even help to recreate
it altogether. Hildebrand points to the success of the method
when applied to the science of language. Henceforth economics was
to become the science of national development.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>In the prospectus of the <i>Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und
Statistik</i>, founded by him in 1863, Hildebrand goes a step farther.
He challenges the teaching of the Classical economists, especially on
the question of national economic laws, and he even blames Roscher
because he had ventured to recognise their existence.<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> He did not
seem to realise that a denial of that kind involved the undoing of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
economic science and the complete overthrow of those “laws of
development” which he believed were henceforth to be the basis of
the science.</p>

<p>But Hildebrand’s absolutism had no more influence than
Roscher’s eclecticism, unless we make an exception of his generalisation
concerning the three phases of economic development, which
he differentiates as follows: the period of natural economy, that of
money economy, and finally that of credit. Beyond that he merely
contented himself with publishing a number of fragmentary studies
on special questions of statistics or history, without, for the most
part, making any attempt to modify the Classical theory of production
and distribution.</p>

<p>The critical study of 1848 hinted at a sequel which was to embody
the principles of the new method. But the sequel never appeared,
and the difficult task of carrying the subject farther was entrusted
to Karl Knies, another professor, who in 1853 published a bulky
treatise bearing the title of <i>Political Economy from the Historical
Point of View</i>.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> But there is as much divergence between his
views and those of his predecessors as there is between Roscher’s
and Hildebrand’s. He not only questions the existence of natural
laws, but even doubts whether there are any laws of development
at all—a point Hildebrand never had any doubts about—and thinks
that all we can say is that there are certain analogies presented by
the development of different countries. Knies cannot share in the
belief of either Hildebrand or Roscher, nor does he hold with the
Classical school. He thinks that political economy is simply a
history of ideas concerning the economic development of a nation at
different periods of its growth.</p>

<p>Knies’s work passed almost unnoticed, ignored by historians and
economists alike, until the younger Historical school called attention
to his book, of which a new edition appeared in 1883. Knies makes
frequent complaints of Roscher’s neglect to consider his ideas.</p>

<p>Such heroic professions naturally lead us to expect that Knies
would spare no effort to show the superiority of the new method.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
But his subsequent works dealing with money and credit, upon which
his real reputation rests, bear scarcely a trace of the Historical spirit.</p>

<p>The three founders of the science devoted a great deal of time
to a criticism of the Classical method, but failed to agree as to the
aim and scope of the science and left to others the task of applying
their principles.</p>

<p>This task was attempted by the newer Historical school, which
sprang up around Schmoller towards the end of 1870. This new
school possesses two distinctive characteristics.</p>

<p>(1) The useless controversy concerning economic laws which
Hildebrand and Knies had raised is abandoned. The members of the
school are careful not to deny the existence of natural social laws or
uniformities, and they considered that the search for these was the
chief object of the science. In reality they are economic determinists.
“We know now,” says Schmoller,<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> “that psychical causation
is something other than mechanical, but it bears the same
stamp of necessity.” What they do deny is that these laws are
discoverable by Classical methods, and on this point they agree with
every criticism made by their predecessors.</p>

<p>As to the possibility of formulating “the laws of development”
upon which Hildebrand laid such stress, they professed themselves
very sceptical. “We have no knowledge of the laws of history,
although we sometimes speak of economic and statistical laws,”<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
writes Schmoller. “We cannot,” he regretfully says later, “even
say whether the economic life of humanity possesses any element
of unity or shows any traces of uniform development, or whether
it is making for progress at all.”<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> This very characteristic passage
from Schmoller was written in 1904,<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> and forms the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
of the great synthetic treatise. All attempts at a philosophy of
history are treated with the same disdain.<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p>(2) The newer Historical school, not content merely with advocating
the use of the Historical method, hastened to put theory
into practice. Since about 1860 German economists have shown a
disposition to turn away from economic theory and to devote their
entire energy to practical problems, sociological studies and historical
or realistic research. The number of economic monographs has
increased enormously. The institutions of the Middle Ages and of
antiquity, the economic doctrines of the ancients, statistics, the
economic organisation of the present day, these are some of the topics
discussed. Political economy is lost in the maze of realistic studies,
whether of the present day or of the past.</p>

<p>Although the Historical school has done an enormous amount of
work we must not forget that historical monographs were printed
before their time, and that certain socialistic treatises, such as
Marx’s <i>Kapital</i>, are really attempts at historical synthesis. The
special merit of the school consists in the impulse it gave to systematic
study of this description. The result has been a renewed interest
in history and in the development of economic institutions. We
cannot attempt an account of all these works and their varied
contents. We must remain satisfied if we can catch the spirit of
the movement. The names of Schmoller, Brentano, Held, Bücher,
and Sombart are known to every student of economic history.
Marshall, the greatest of modern theorists, has on more than one
occasion paid them a glowing tribute.<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p>The movement soon left Germany, and it was speedily realised
that conditions abroad were equally favourable for its work.</p>

<p>By the end of 1870 practical Liberalism had spent its force. But
new problems were coming to the front, especially the labour question,
which demanded immediate attention.<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> Classical economists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
had no solution to offer, and the new study of economic institutions,
of social organisation, and of the life of the masses seemed to be the
only hopeful method of gaining light upon the question. Comparison
with the past was expected to lead to a better understanding
of the present. The Historical method seemed to social reformers
to be the one instrument of progress, and a strong desire for some
practical result fostered belief in it. When we remember the
prestige which German science has enjoyed since 1871, and the success
of the Germans in combining historical research with the advocacy
of State Socialism, we can understand the enthusiasm with which
the method was greeted abroad.</p>

<p>Even in England, the stronghold of Ricardian economics, the
influence of the school becomes quite plain after 1870.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, a controversy as to the method employed
manifests itself. Cairnes in his work <i>The Character and Logical
Method of Political Economy</i> (1875<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>), writing quite in the spirit of the
old Classical authors, strongly advocates the employment of the
deductive method. In 1879 Cliffe Leslie, in his <i>Essays on Political
and Moral Philosophy</i>, enters the lists against Cairnes and makes use
of the new weapons to drive home his arguments. The use of
induction rather than deduction, the constant necessity for keeping
economics in living touch with other social sciences, the relative
character of economic laws, and the employment of history as a
means of interpreting economic phenomena, are among the arguments
adopted and developed by Leslie. Toynbee, in his <i>Lectures
on the Industrial Revolution</i>, gave utterance to similar views, but
showed much greater moderation. While recognising the claims of
deduction, he thought that history and observation would give new
life and lend a practical interest to economics. The remoteness and
unreality of the Ricardian school constituted its greatest weakness,
and social reform would in his opinion greatly benefit by the
introduction of new methods. Toynbee would undoubtedly have
exercised tremendous influence; but his life, full of the brightest
hopes, was cut short at thirty.</p>

<p>The lead had been given; the study of economic institutions
and classes was henceforth to occupy a permanent position in
English economic writings, and the remarkable works which have
since been published, such as Cunningham’s <i>Growth of English
Industry and Commerce</i>, Ashley’s <i>Economic History</i>, the Webbs’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
<i>Trade Unionism and Industrial Democracy</i>, Booth’s <i>Life and Labour
of the People</i>, bear witness to the profound influence exerted by the
new ideas.</p>

<p>In France the success of the movement has not been quite so
pronounced, although the need for it was as keenly felt there.
Although it did not result in the founding of a French school of
economic historians, the new current of ideas has influenced French
economic thought in a thousand ways. In 1878 political economy
became a recognised subject in the various curricula of the Facultés
de Droit. The intimate connection between economic study and
the study of law has given an entirely new significance to political
economy, and the science has been entirely transformed by the
infusion of the historical spirit. At the same time professional
historians have become more and more interested in problems of
economic history, thus bringing a spirit of healthy rivalry into the study
of economic institutions. Several Liberal economists also, without
breaking with the Classical tradition, have devoted their energies to the
close observation of contemporary facts or to historical research.<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p>Finally, we have a new group of workers in the sociologists.
Sociology is interested in the origin and growth of social institutions
of all kinds and in the influence which they have exerted upon one
another. After studying institutions of a religious, legal, political,
or social character it is only natural that they should ask that the
study of economic institutions should be carried on in the same
spirit and with the help of the same method. This object has been
enthusiastically pursued for some time. The mechanism and the
organisation of the economic system at different periods have been
closely examined by the aid of observation and history. Abstraction
has been laid aside and a preference shown for minute observation,
and for induction rather than deduction.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading51">II: THE CRITICAL IDEAS OF THE HISTORICAL SCHOOL</h4>

<p>Among so many writers whose works cover such a long period of
time we can hardly expect to find absolute unanimity, and we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
already had occasion to note some of the more important divergencies
between them, especially those separating the newer from the older
writers of the Historical school. We cannot here enter into a full
discussion of all these various shades of opinion, and we must be
content to mention the more important features upon which they
are almost entirely at one, noticing some of the principal individual
doctrines by the way.</p>

<p>The German Historical school made its <i>début</i> with a criticism
of Classical economics, and we cannot better begin than with a study
of its critical ideas.<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>Although these ideas had already found expression in the writings
of Knies, Hildebrand, and Roscher, there was nothing like the discussion
which was provoked by them when the newer Historical
school, at a much later period, again brought them to public notice.
The publication of Karl Menger’s work, <i>Untersuchungen über die
Methode der Socialwissenschaften</i>, in 1883—a classic both in style and
matter—ushered in a new era of active polemics. This remarkable
work, in which the author undertakes the defence of pure political
economy against the attacks of the German Historical school,
was received with some amount of ill-feeling by the members of
that school,<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> and it caused a general searching of hearts during the
next few years. We must try to bring out the essential elements
in the discussion, and contrast the arguments advanced by the
Historians with the replies offered by their critics.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, three charges are levelled at the Classical
writers. (i) It is pointed out that their belief in the universality
of their doctrines is not easily justified. (ii) Their psychology is
said to be too crude, based as it is simply upon egoism. (iii) Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
use, or rather abuse, of the deductive method is said to be wholly
unjustifiable. We will review these charges <i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>The Historians held that the greatest sin committed by Smith
and his followers was the inordinate stress which they laid upon the
universality of their doctrines. Hildebrand applies the term “universalism”
to this feature of their teaching, while Knies refers to it as “absolutism”
or “perpetualism.” The belief of the Anglo-French school,
according to their version of it, was that the economic laws which they
had formulated were operative everywhere and at all times, and that
the system of political economy founded upon them was universal
in its application. The Historians, on the other hand, maintained
that these laws, so far from being categorically imperative, should be
regarded always as being subject to change in both theory and practice.</p>

<p>First with regard to practice. A uniform code of economic
legislation cannot be indifferently applied to all countries at all
epochs of their history. An attempt must be made to adapt it to
the varied conditions of time and place. The statesman’s art
consists in adapting principles to meet new demands and in inventing
solutions for new problems. But, as Menger points out, this
obvious principle, which was by no means a new one, would have
met with the approval of Smith and Say, and even of Ricardo
himself;<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> although they occasionally forgot it, perhaps, especially
when judging the institutions of the past or when advocating the
universal adoption of <i>laissez-faire</i>.</p>

<p>The second idea, namely, that economic theory and economic
laws have only a relative value, is treated with even greater emphasis,
and this was another point on which the older economists had gone
wrong. Economic laws, unlike the laws of physics and chemistry,
with which the Classical writers were never tired of comparing them,
have neither the universality nor the inevitability of the latter. Knies
has laid special stress on this point. “The conditions of economic
life determine the form and character of economic theory. Both
the process of argument employed and the results arrived at are
products of historical development. The arguments are based
upon the facts of concrete economic life and the results bear all the
marks of historical solutions. The generalisations of economics
are simply historical explanations and progressive manifestations of
truth. Each step is a generalisation of the truth as it is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
at that particular stage of development. No single formula and no
collection of such formulæ can ever claim to be final.”<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>This paragraph, though somewhat obscure and diffuse, as is often
the case with Knies, expresses a sound idea which other economists
have stated somewhat differently, by saying that economic laws
are at once provisional and conditional. They are provisional in
the sense that the progress of history continually gives rise to new
facts of which existing theories do not take sufficient account.
Hence the economist finds himself obliged to modify the formulæ
with which he has hitherto been quite content. They are conditional
in the sense that economic laws are only true so long as other
circumstances do not hinder their action. The slightest change in
the conditions as ordinarily given might cancel the usual result.
Those economists who thought of their theory as a kind of final
revelation, or considered that their predictions were absolutely
certain, needed reminding of this.</p>

<p>But Knies is hopelessly wrong in thinking that this relativity is
enough to separate the laws of economics from the laws of other
sciences. Professor Marshall justly remarks that chemical and
physical laws likewise undergo transformation whenever new facts
render the old formulæ inadequate. All these laws are provisional.
They are also hypothetical in the sense that they are true only in the
absence of any disturbing cause. Scientists no longer consider these
laws as inherent in matter. They are the product of man’s thought
and they advance with the development of his intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> They are
nothing more or less than formulæ which conveniently express the
relation of dependence that exists between different phenomena;
and between these various laws as they are framed by the human
mind there is no difference except a greater or lesser degree of proof
which supports them.</p>

<p>What gives to the laws of physics or chemistry that larger amount
of fixity and that greater degree of certainty which render them
altogether superior to economic law as at present formulated is a
greater uniformity in the conditions that give rise to them, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
fact that their action is often measurable in accordance with
mathematical principles.<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>Not only has Knies exaggerated the importance of his doctrine
of relativity,<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> but the imputation that his predecessors had failed
to realise the need for it was hardly deserved. We shall have to
refer to this matter again. Mill’s <i>Principles</i> was already published,
and even in the <i>Logic</i>, which appeared for the first time in 1843, and
several editions of which had been issued before 1853, the year when
Knies writes, we meet with the following sentence:<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> “The motive
that suggests the separation of this portion of the social phenomenon
from the rest … is that they do mainly depend at least in the first
resort on one class of circumstances only; and that even when other
circumstances interfere, the ascertainment of the effect due to the
one class of circumstances alone is a sufficiently intricate and
difficult business to make it expedient to perform it once for all
and then allow for the effect of the modifying circumstances.”
Consequently sociology, of which political economy is simply a
branch, is a science of tendencies and not of positive conclusions.
No better expression of the principle of relativity could ever be given.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, modern economists have come to the
conclusion that the criticisms of the Historical school are sufficiently
well founded to justify them in demanding greater precision so as
to avoid those mistakes in the future. Dr. Marshall, for one, adopts
Mill’s expression, and defines an economic law as “a statement of
economic tendencies.”<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>Even the founders of pure political economy, although their
method is obviously very different from that of the Historians, have
taken similar precautions. They expressly declare that the conclusions
of the science are based upon a certain number of preliminary
hypotheses deliberately chosen, and that the said conclusions are
only provisionally true. “Pure economics,” says Walras, “has to
borrow its notion of exchange, of demand and supply, of capital
and revenue, from actual life, and out of those conceptions it has to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
build the ideal or abstract type upon which the economist exercises
his reasoning powers.”<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> Pure economics studies the effects of competition,
not under the imperfect conditions of an actual market,
but as it would operate in a hypothetical market where each
individual, knowing his own interests, would be able to pursue them
quite freely, and in full publicity. The conception of a limited
area within which competition is fully operative enables us to study
as through a magnifying-glass the results of a hypothesis that really
very seldom operates in the economic life of to-day.</p>

<p>We may dispute the advantages of such a method, but we cannot
say that the economists ever wished to deny the relativity of a
conclusion arrived at in this fashion.</p>

<p>While willing to admit that the Historians have managed to
put this characteristic in a clear light just when some economists
were in danger of forgetting it, and that it is a universally accepted
doctrine to-day, we cannot accept Knies’s contention that it affords
a sufficient basis for the distinction between natural and economic
laws. And such is the opinion of a large number, if not of the
majority, of economists.<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>The second charge is levelled against the narrowness and
insufficiency of the psychology. Adam Smith treated man as a
being solely dominated by considerations of self-interest and completely
absorbed in the pursuit of gain. But, as the Historians
justly point out, personal interest is far from being the sole motive,
even in the economic world. The motives here, as elsewhere, are
extremely varied: vanity, the desire for glory, pleasure afforded by
the work itself, the sense of duty, pity, benevolence, love of kin, or
simply custom.<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> To say that man is always and irremediably
actuated by purely selfish motives, says Knies, is to deny the
existence of any better motive or to regard man as a being having
a number of centres of psychical activity, each operating independently
of the other.<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>We cannot deny that the Classical writers believed that
“personal interest”—not in the sense of egoism, which is the name
given it by Knies, and which somewhat distorts their view—held the
key to the significance and origin of economic life. But the claims
of the Historians are again immoderate. Being themselves chiefly
concerned with concrete reality in all its complexity of being, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
with all its distinctive and special features rather than its general
import, they forgot that the primary aim of political economy is
to study economic phenomena <i>en masse</i>. The Classical economists
studied the crowd, not the individual. If we neglect the differences
that occasionally arise in special cases, and allow for the personal
equation, do we not find that the most constant motive to action is
just this personal desire for well-being and profit? This is the
opinion of Wagner, who on this question of method is not quite in
agreement with other members of the school. In his suggestive study
of the different motives that influence economic conduct he definitely
states that the only motive that is really constant and permanent in
its action is this self-interest. “This consideration,” he says, “does
something to explain and to justify the conduct of those writers who
took this as the starting-point of their study of economics.”<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>But having admitted this, we must also recognise, not that they
denied the changes occasionally undergone by self-interest under the
pressure of other motives, as Knies suggests, but that they have
neglected to take sufficient account of such modifications. Sometimes
it really seems as if they would “transform political economy
into a mere natural history of egoism,” as Hildebrand says.</p>

<p>We can only repeat the remark which we have already made,
namely, that when this criticism was offered it was scarcely justified.
Stuart Mill had drawn attention to this point in his <i>Logic</i> ten years
previously.<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> “An English political economist, like his countrymen
in general, has seldom learned that it is possible that men in conducting
the business of selling their goods over the counter should care
more about their ease or their vanity than about their pecuniary
gain.” For his own part he ventures to say that “there is perhaps
no action of a man’s life in which he is neither under the immediate
nor under the remote influence of any impulse but the mere desire
of wealth.”<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that Mill did not think that self-interest was
the one unchangeable and universal human motive. Much less
“egoism,” for, as we have seen in the previous chapter, his “egoism”
includes a considerable admixture of altruism.</p>

<p>But here again the strictures of the Historians, though somewhat
exaggerated, have forced economists of other schools to be more
precise in their statements. The economists of to-day, as Marshall
remarks, are concerned “with man as he is; not with an abstract
or ‘economic’ man, but a man of flesh and blood.”<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> And if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
economist, as Marshall points out, pays special attention to the desire
for gain among the other motives which influence human beings,
this is not because he is anxious to reduce the science to a mere
“natural history of egoism,” but because in this world of ours money
is the one convenient means of measuring human motive on a large
scale.<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> Even the Hedonists, whose economics rest upon a calculus
of pleasure and pain, are careful to note that their hypothesis is just
a useful simplification of concrete reality, and that such simplification
is absolutely necessary in order to carry the analysis of economic phenomena
as far as possible. It is an abstraction—imposed by necessity,
which is its sole justification, but an abstraction nevertheless.</p>

<p>It is just here that the final reproach comes in, namely, the charge
of abusing the employment of abstraction and deduction, and greater
stress is laid upon this count than upon either of the other two.</p>

<p>Instead of deduction the new school would substitute induction
based upon observation.</p>

<p>Their criticism of the deductive method is closely connected with
their attack upon the psychology of the older school. The Classical
economists thought, so the Historians tell us, that all economic
laws could be deduced by a simple process of reasoning from one
fundamental principle. If we consider the multiplicity of motives
actually operative in the economic world, the insufficiency of this
doctrine becomes immediately apparent. The result is not a
faithful picture, but a caricature of reality. Only by patient
observation and careful induction can we hope to build up an
economic theory that shall take full account of the complexity of
economic phenomena. “There is a new future before political
economy,” writes Schmoller in 1883, in reply to a letter of Menger,
“thanks to the use that will be made of the historical matter,
both descriptive and statistical, that is slowly accumulating. It
will not come by further distillation of the abstract propositions of
the old dogmatism that have already been distilled a hundred times.”<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>The younger school especially has insisted on this; and Menger
has ventured to say that in the opinion of the newer Historical school
“the art of abstract thinking, even when distinguished by profundity
and originality of the highest order, and when based upon a foundation
of wide experience—in a word, the exercise of that gift which has in
other sciences resulted in winning the highest honour for the thinkers—seems
to be of quite secondary importance, if not absolutely worthless,
as compared with some elaborate compilation or other.”<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>But the criticism of the Historical school confuses two things,
namely, the particular use which the Classical writers have made of
the abstract deductive method, and the method itself.</p>

<p>No one will deny that the Classical writers often started with
insufficient premises. Even when the premises were correct, they
were too ready to think and not careful enough to prove that their
conclusions were always borne out by the facts. No one can defend
their incomplete analysis, their hasty generalisations, or their
ambiguous formulæ.<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>But this is very different from denying the legitimacy of abstraction
and deduction. To isolate a whole class of motives with a view
to a separate examination of their effects is not to deny either the
presence or the action of other motives, any more than a study of
the effect of gravitation upon a solid involves the denial of the
action of other forces upon it. In a science like political economy,
where experiment is practically impossible, abstraction and analysis
afford the only means of escape from those other influences which
complicate the problems so much. Even if the motives chosen were
of secondary importance, the procedure would be quite legitimate,
although the result would not be of any great moment. But it is
of the greatest service and value when the motive chosen is one,
like the search for gain or the desire for personal satisfaction, which
exercises a preponderant influence upon economic action.<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>So natural, we may even say so indispensable, is abstraction,
if we are to help the mind steer its way amid the complexity
of economic phenomena, that the criticism of the Historical school
has done nothing to hinder the remarkable development which has
resulted from the use of the abstract method during the last thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
years. But, although the Neo-Classical school has succeeded in
replacing the old methods in their position of honour once more, it
no longer employs those methods in the way the older writers did.
A more solid foundation has been given them in a more exact
analysis of the needs which personal interest ought to satisfy.<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> And
the mechanism of deduction itself has been perfected by a more
rigid use of the ordinary logical forms, and by the adoption of
mathematical phraseology.</p>

<p>Happily the controversy as to the merits of the rival methods,
which was first raised by the Historical school, has no very great
interest at the present moment. Most eminent economists consider
that both are equally necessary. There seems to be a general
agreement among writers of different schools to consider the question
of method of secondary importance, and to forget the futile controversies
from which the science has gained so little. Before concluding
this section it may be worth while to quote the opinion of men
who represent very different tendencies, but are entirely agreed with
regard to this one subject. “Discussion of method,” says Pareto,
“is a pure waste of time. The aim of the science is to discover
economic uniformities, and it is always right to follow any path
or to pursue any method that is likely to lead to that end.”<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> “For
this and other reasons,” says Marshall, “there always has been,
and there probably always will be, a need for the existence side by
side of workers with different aptitudes and different aims.… All
the devices for the discovery of the relations between cause and
effect which are described in treatises on scientific method have to
be used in their turn by the economist.”<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>These writers generally employ the abstract method. Let us now
hear some of the Historians. Schmoller is the author of that oft-quoted
phrase, “Induction and deduction are both necessary for
the science, just as the right and left foot are needed for walking.”<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>More remarkable still, perhaps, is the opinion of Bücher, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
author to whom the Historical school is indebted for some of its
most valuable contributions. “It is therefore a matter of great
satisfaction that, after a period of diligent collection of material, the
economic problems of modern commerce have in recent times been
zealously taken up again and that an attempt is being made to
correct and develop the old system in the same way in which it
arose, with the aid, however, of a much larger store of facts. For
the only method of investigation which will enable us to approach
the complex causes of commercial phenomena is that of abstract
isolation and logical deduction. The sole inductive process that can
likewise be considered—namely, the statistical—is not sufficiently
exact and penetrating for most of the problems that have to be
handled here, and can be employed only to supplement or control.”<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading52">III: THE POSITIVE IDEAS OF THE HISTORICAL SCHOOL</h4>

<p>What made the criticism of the Historians so penetrating was the
fact that they held an entirely different view concerning the scope
and aim of economics. Behind the criticism lurked the counter-theory.
Nothing less than a complete transformation of the science
would have satisfied the founders, but the younger school soon
discovered that so ambitious a scheme could never be carried out.
It is important that we should know something of the view of
those older writers on this question, and the way they had intended
to give effect to their plans. The positive contribution made by the
Historical school to economic study is even more important than
its criticisms, for it gives a clue to an entirely different point of
view with which we are continually coming into contact in our
study of economic doctrines.</p>

<p>The study of economic phenomena may be approached from two
opposite standpoints, which we may designate the mechanical and
the organic. The one is the vantage-ground of those thinkers who love
generalisations, and who seek to reduce the complexity of the economic
world to the compass of a few formulæ; the other of those writers who
are attracted by the constant change which concrete reality presents.</p>

<p>The earlier economists for the most part belonged to the former
class. Amid all the wealth and variety of economic phenomena
they confined their attention almost entirely to those aspects that
could be explained on simple mechanical principles. Such were the
problems of price fluctuations, the rate of interest, wages, and rent.
Production adapting itself to meet variation in demand, with no guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
save personal interest, looked for all the world like the intermolecular
action of free human beings in competition with one another. The
simplicity of the idea was not without a certain grandeur of its own.</p>

<p>But such a conception of economic life is an extremely limited
one. A whole mass of economic phenomena of the highest importance
and of the greatest interest is left entirely outside. The
phenomena of the economic world, as a matter of fact, are extremely
varied and changeable. There are institutions and organisations
without number, banks and exchanges, associations of masters and
unions of men, commercial leagues and co-operative societies.
Eternal struggle between the small tradesman and the big manufacturer,
between the merchant and the combine, between the
peasant proprietor and the great landowner, between classes and
individuals, between public and private interests, between town and
country, is the common feature of economic life. A state rises to
prosperity again to fall to ruin. Competition at one moment makes
it superior, at another reduces its lead. A country changes its
commercial policy at one period to reintroduce the old <i>régime</i> at
another. Economic life fulfils its purposes by employing different
organs that are continually modified to meet changing conditions,
and are gradually transformed as science progresses and manners
and beliefs are revolutionised.</p>

<p>Of all this the mechanical conception tells us nothing. It makes
no attempt to explain the economic differences which separate
nations and differentiate epochs. Its theory of wages tells us
nothing about the different classes of workpeople, or of their well-being
during successive periods of history, or about the legal and
political conditions upon which that well-being depends. Its theory
of interest tells us nothing of the various forms under which interest
has appeared at different times, or of the gradual evolution of
money, whether metallic or paper. Its theory of profits ignores
the changes which industry has undergone, its concentration and
expansion, its individualistic nature at one moment, its collective
trend at another. No attempt is made to distinguish between
profits in industry or commerce and profits in agriculture. The
Classical economists were simply in search of those universal and
permanent phenomena amid which the <i>homo œconomicus</i> most readily
betrayed his character.</p>

<p>The mechanical view is evidently inadequate if we wish to
delineate concrete economic life in all its manifold activity. We
are simply given certain general results, which afford no clue to the
concrete and special character of economic phenomena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>The weakness of the mechanical conception arises out of the
fact that it isolates man’s economic activity, but neglects his environment.
The economic action of man must influence his surroundings.
The character of such action and the effects which follow from it
differ according to the physical and social, the political and religious
surroundings wherein they are operative. A country’s geographical
situation, its natural resources, the scientific and artistic training of
its inhabitants, their moral and intellectual character, and even
their system of government, must determine the nature of its
economic institutions, and the degree of well-being or prosperity
enjoyed by its inhabitants. Wealth is produced, distributed, and
exchanged in some fashion or other in every stage of social development,
but each human society forms a separate organic unit, in
which these functions are carried out in a particular way, giving,
accordingly, to that society a distinctive character entirely its
own. If we want to understand all the different aspects of this life
we must make a study of its economic activity, not as it were <i>in
vacuo</i>, but in connection with the medium through which it finds expression,
and which alone can help us to understand its true nature.<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>This was the first doctrine on which they laid stress: the other
follows immediately. This social environment cannot be regarded
as fixed. It is constantly undergoing some change. It is in process
of transformation and of evolution. At no two successive moments
of its existence is it quite the same. Each successive stage calls for
explanation, which history alone can give. Goethe has given
utterance to this thought in a memorable phrase which serves as a
kind of epigraph to Schmoller’s great work, the <i>Grundriss</i>. “A
person who has no knowledge of the three thousand years of history
which have gone by must remain content to dwell in obscurity,
living a hand-to-mouth existence.” We must have some knowledge
of the previous stages of economic development if we are to understand
the economic life of the present. Just as naturalists and
geologists in their anxiety to understand the present have invented
hypotheses to explain the evolution of the globe and of living
matter upon it, so must the student of economics return to the
distant past if he wants to get hold of the industrial life of to-day.
“Man as a social being,” says Hildebrand, “is the child of civilisation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
and a product of history. His wants, his intellectual outlook,
his relation to material objects, and his connection with other
human beings have not always been the same. Geography influences
them, history modifies them, while the progress of education
may entirely transform them.”<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>The Historians maintained that the earlier economists by paying
exclusive attention to those broader conclusions which had something
of the generality of physical laws about them had kept the
science within too narrow limits. Alongside of theory as they had
conceived of it—some Historians would say instead of it—there is
room for another study more closely akin to biology, namely, a detailed
description and a historical explanation of the constitution of the
economic life of each nation. Such is the positive contribution of
the school to the study of political economy, and it fairly represents
the attitude of the present-day Historians towards the older
economists.</p>

<p>Their aim was a perfectly natural and legitimate one, and at first
sight, at least, seemed very attractive. But beneath its apparent
simplicity there is some amount of obscurity, and its adversaries
have thought that upon close analysis it is really open to serious
objections.</p>

<p>In the first place, is it the aim of the science to present us with
an exact, realistic picture of society, as the Historians loved to think?
On the contrary, do we not find that a study can only aspire to
the name of a science in proportion as its propositions become more
general in their nature? There is no science without generalisation,
according to Aristotle, and concrete description, however indispensable,
is only a first step in the constitution of a science. A science
must be explanatory rather than descriptive.</p>

<p>Of course Historians are not always content with mere description.
Some Historians have attempted explanation and have employed
history as their organon. Is the choice a suitable one?</p>

<p>“History,” says Marshall, “tells of sequences and coincidences;
but reason alone can interpret and draw lessons from them.”<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, is there a single important historical event whose cause
has ceased to be a matter of discussion? It will be a long time
before people cease to dispute about the causes of the Reformation or
the Revolution, and the relative importance of economic, political,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and moral influences in determining the course of those movements
has yet to be assigned. The causes that led to the substitution
of credit for money or money for barter are equally obscure. Before
narrative can become science there must be the preliminary discovery
by a number of other sciences of the many diverse laws whose
combination gives rise to concrete phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Not history but the
sciences give the true explanation. The evolutionary theory has
proved fruitful in natural history simply because it took the succession
of animal species as an established fact and then discovered
that heredity and selection afforded a means of explaining that
succession. But history cannot give us any hypothesis that can
rival the theory of evolution either in its scientific value or in its
simplicity. In other words, history itself is in need of explanation.
It gives no clue to reality and it can never take the place of
economics.<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p>The earlier Historians claimed a higher mission still for the
historical study of political economy. It must not only afford
an explanation of concrete economic reality, but it must also formulate
the laws of economic development. This idea is only held
by a few of them, and even the few are not agreed as to how it should
be done. Knies, for example, thinks that it ought to be sufficiently
general to include the economic development of all nations. Saint-Simon
held somewhat similar views. Others, and among them
Roscher, hold that there exist parallelisms in the history of various
nations; in other words, that every nation in the course of its
economic development passes through certain similar phases or
stages. These similarities constitute the laws of economics. If we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
were to study their movements in the civilisations of the past we
might be able to estimate their place in existing societies.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<p>Neither point seems very clear. Even if we admit that there
is only one general law of human development we cannot forecast
the line of progress, because scientific prediction is only applicable
to recurrent phenomena. They fail just when the conditions are
new. Of course one can always guess at the nature of the future,
but divination is not knowledge. And predictions of this kind are
almost always false.<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> Historical parallelism rests on equally shaky
foundations. A nation, like any other living organism, passes through
the successive stages of youth, maturity, and old age, but we are not
justified in thinking that the successive phases through which one
nation has passed must be a kind of prototype to which all others
must conform. All that we can say is that in two neighbouring
countries the same effects are likely to follow from the same causes.
Production on a large scale, for example, has been accompanied
by similar phenomena in most countries in Western Europe. But
this is by no means an inevitable law. It is simply a case of similar
effects resulting from similar causes. Such analogies are hardly
worthy of the name of laws. The discovery of the law, as Wagner
says,<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> may be a task beyond human power; and Schmoller, as we
have already seen, is of the same opinion.</p>

<p>One remark before concluding. There is a striking similarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
between the ideas just outlined and those of a distinguished philosopher
whose name deserves mention here, although his influence
upon political economy was practically <i>nil</i>. We refer to Auguste
Comte.</p>

<p>It is curious that the earliest representatives of the school should
have ignored him altogether, but just as Mill remained unknown to
them, so the <i>Cours de Philosophie positive</i>, though published in 1842,
remained a sealed book so far as they were concerned. Comte’s
ideas are so very much like those of Knies and Hildebrand that some
Positivist economists, such as Ingram and Hector Denis, have
attempted to connect the Historical tendency in political economy
with the Positive philosophy of Comte.<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>The three fundamental conceptions which formed the basis of the
teaching of the Historical school are clearly formulated by Comte.
The first is the importance of studying economic phenomena in
connection with other social facts. The analysis of the industrial
or economic life of society can never be carried on in the “positive”
spirit by simply making an abstraction of its intellectual, political,
or moral life, whether of the past or of the present.<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> The second is
the employment of history as the organon of social science. “Social
research,” says he, “must be based upon a sane analysis of the all-round
development of the best of mankind up to the present moment,
and the growing predilection for historical study in our time augurs
well for the regeneration of political economy.” He was fully persuaded
that the method would foster scientific prediction—a feature
which is bound to fuse all those diverse conditions which will form
the basis of Positive politics.</p>

<p>Comte wished to found sociology, of which political economy was
to be simply a branch. The Historical school, and especially Knies,
regarded economics in the same spirit. Hence the analogies with
which Knies had to content himself, but which the younger school
refused to recognise. But there was a fundamental difference
between their respective points of view, and this will help us to
distinguish between them.</p>

<p>Comte was a believer in inevitable natural laws, which, according
to the earlier Historians, had wrought such havoc. The
Historical method also, as he conceived of it, was something very
different from what the older or the newer Historical school took it
to be.</p>

<p>Adopting a dictum of Saint-Simon, Comte speaks of the Historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
method as an attempt to establish in ascending or descending series
the curve of each social institution, and to deduce from its general
outlines conclusions as to its probable growth or decline in the
future. This is how he himself defines the process: “The essence
of this so-called historical spirit, it seems to us, consists in the rational
use of what may be called the social series method, or, in other words,
in the due appreciation of the successive stages of human development
as reflected in a succession of historical facts. Careful study
of such facts, whether physical, intellectual, moral, or political,
reveals a continuous growth on the one hand and an equally continuous
decline on the other. Hence there results the possibility
of scientific prophecy concerning the final ascendancy of the former
and the complete overthrow of the latter, provided always such
conclusion is in conformity with the general laws of human development,
the sociological preponderance of which must never be
lost sight of.”<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> It was in virtue of this method that Saint-Simon
predicted the coming of industrialism and that Comte
prophesied the triumph of the positive spirit over the metaphysical
and religious.</p>

<p>There is considerable difference between this attitude and the
Historical method as we know it,<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> and the attempt at affiliation seems
to us altogether unwarranted. But the coincidence between Comte’s
views and those of Knies and Hildebrand is none the less remarkable,
and it affords a further proof of the existence of that general feeling
which prompted certain writers towards the middle of the century
to attempt a regeneration of political economy by setting it free
from the tyranny of those general laws which had nearly stifled
its life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems to us, however, that the Historical school is mistaken
if it imagines that history alone can afford an explanation of the
present or will ever enable us to discover those special laws which
determine the evolution of nations.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it has a perfect right to demand a place beside
economic science, and it is undoubtedly destined to occupy a position
still more prominent in the study of economic institutions, in statistical
investigation, and above all in economic history. Not only is
a detailed description of the concrete life of the present of absorbing
interest in itself, but it is the condition precedent to all speculations
concerning the future. The theorist can never afford to neglect the
minute observation of facts unless he wills that his structure shall
hang in the void. Most abstract economists feel no hesitation in
recognising this. For example, Jevons, writing in 1879,<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> gave it as
his opinion that “in any case there must arise a science of the
development of economic forces and relations.”</p>

<p>This newer historical conception came to the rescue just when the
science was about to give up the ghost, and though they may have
failed to give us that synthetic reconstruction which is, after all,
within the ability of very few writers, its advocates have succeeded
in infusing new life into the study and in stimulating new interest in
political economy by bringing it again into touch with contemporary
life. They have done this by throwing new light upon the past and
by giving us a detailed account of the more interesting and more
complex phenomena of the present time.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Such work must necessarily
be of a fragmentary character. The school has collected a
wonderful amount of first-class material, but it has not yet erected
that palace of harmonious proportions to which we in our fond imagination
had likened the science of the future. Nor has it discovered
the clue which can help it to find its way through the chaos of
economic life. This is not much to be wondered at when we remember
the shortcomings of the method to which we have already had
occasion to refer. Indeed, some of the writers of the school seem
fully convinced of this. Professor Ashley, in an article contributed
to the <i>Economic Journal</i>, employs the following words:<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>
“As I have already observed, the criticisms of the Historical school
have not led so far to the creation of a new political economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
on historical lines: even in Germany it is only within very recent
years that some of the larger outlines of such an economics
have begun to loom up before us in the great treatise of Gustav
Schmoller.”</p>

<p>In view of considerations like these one might have expected
that the Historical school would have shown greater indulgence to
the attempts made both by the Classical and by the Hedonistic
schools to give by a different method expression to the same instinctive
desire to simplify matters in order to understand them better.<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II_STATE_SOCIALISM">CHAPTER II: STATE SOCIALISM</h3>

<p>The nineteenth century opened with a feeling of contempt for
government of every kind, and with unbounded confidence on the
part of at least every publicist in the virtue of economic liberty
and individual initiative. It closed amid the clamour for State
intervention in all matters affecting economic or social organisation.
In every country the number of public men and of economists who
favour an extension of the economic function of government is
continually growing, and to-day such men are certainly in the
majority. To some writers this change of opinion has seemed
sufficiently important to warrant special treatment as a new doctrine,
variously known as State Socialism or “the Socialism of the Chair”
in Germany and Interventionism in France.</p>

<p>Really it is not an economic question at all, but a question of
practical politics upon which writers of various shades of economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
opinion may agree despite extreme differences in their theoretical
preconceptions. The problem of defining the limits of governmental
action in the matter of producing and distributing wealth is
one of the most important in the whole realm of political economy,
but it can hardly be considered a fundamental scientific question
upon which economic opinion is hopelessly divided. It is clear
that the solution of the problem must depend not merely upon
purely economic factors, but also on social and political considerations,
upon the peculiar conception of general interest which the
individual has formed for himself and the amount of confidence
which he can place in the character and ability of Governments.<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>
The problem is always changing, and whenever a new kind of
society is created or a new Government is established a fresh solution
is required to meet the changed conditions.</p>

<p>How is it, then, that this question has assumed such extravagant
proportions at certain periods of our history?</p>

<p>Had the issue been confined to the limits laid down by Smith
it is probable that such passionate controversies would have been
avoided. Smith’s arguments in favour of <i>laissez-faire</i> were largely
economic. Gradually, however, under the growing influence of
individual and political liberty, a kind of contempt for all State
action took the place of the more careful reasoning of the earlier
theory, and the superiority of individual action in matters non-economic
became an accepted axiom with every publicist.</p>

<p>This method of looking at the problem is very characteristic of
Bastiat. The one feature of government that interested him was
not the fact that it represented the general interest of the citizens,
but that whenever it took any action it had to employ force,<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>
whereas individual action is always free. Every substitution of
State for individual action meant victory for force and the defeat
of liberty. Such substitution must consequently be condemned.
Smith’s point of view is totally different. To appreciate this difference
we need only compare their treatment of State action. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
addition to protecting the citizens from invasion and from interference
with their individual rights, Smith adds that the sovereign
should undertake “the duty of erecting and maintaining certain
public works and certain public institutions, which it can never be
for the interest of any individual, or small number of individuals,
to erect and maintain; because the profit could never repay the
expense to any individual or small number of individuals, though it
may frequently do much more than repay it to a great society.”<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>
The scope is sufficiently wide, at any rate. If we turn to Bastiat, on
the other hand, we find that the Government has only two functions
to perform, namely, “to guard public security and to administer
the common land.”<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> Viewed in this light, the problem of governmental
intervention, instead of remaining purely economic, becomes
a question of determining the nature, aims, and functions of the
State, and individual temperament and social traditions play a
much more important part than either the operation of economic
phenomena or any amount of economic reasoning. It is not surprising
that some writers thought that the one aim of economics
was to defend the liberty and the rights of the individual!</p>

<p>Such exaggerated views were bound to beget a reaction, and the
defence of State action assumes equally absurd proportions with
some of the writers of the opposite school. Even as far back as
1856 Dupont-White, a French writer, had uttered a protest against
this persistent depreciation of the State, in a short work entitled
<i>L’Individu et l’État</i>. His ideas are so closely akin to those of the
German State Socialists that they have often been confused with
them, and it is simpler to give an exposition of both at the same
time. But he was a voice crying in the wilderness. Public opinion
under the Second Empire was very little disposed to listen to an
individual who, though a Liberal in politics, was yet anxious to
strengthen the power and to add to the economic prerogative of
the Crown. More favourable circumstances were necessary if there
was to be a change of public opinion on the matter. The times
had ripened by the last quarter of the century, and the elements
proved propitious, especially in Germany, where the reaction first
showed itself.</p>

<p>The reaction took the form not so much of the creation of a
new doctrine as of a fusion of two older currents, which must first
be examined.</p>

<p>During the course of the nineteenth century we find a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
of economists who, while accepting Smith’s fundamental conception,
gradually limit the application of his principle of <i>laissez-faire</i>. They
thought that the superiority of <i>laissez-faire</i> could not be scientifically
demonstrated and that in the great majority of cases some form
of State intervention was necessary.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we meet with a number of socialists who
prove themselves to be more opportunistic than their comrades, and
though equally hostile to private property and freedom of production,
yet never hesitate to address their appeals on behalf of the
workers to existing Governments.</p>

<p>State Socialism represents the fusion of these two currents. It
surpasses the one in its faith in the wisdom of Governments, and is
distinguished from the other by its greater attachment to the
rights of private property; but both of them contribute some items
to its programme. In the first place we must try to discover the
source of these separate tendencies, and in the second place watch
their amalgamation.</p>

<h4 id="heading53">I: THE ECONOMISTS’ CRITICISM OF <i>LAISSEZ-FAIRE</i></h4>

<p>The doctrine of absolute <i>laissez-faire</i> was not long allowed to go
unchallenged. From the time of Smith onward there is an uninterrupted
sequence of writers—all of them by no means socialists—who
ventured to attack the fundamental propositions of the great
Scotsman and who attempted to show that his practical conclusions
were not always borne out by the facts.</p>

<p>Smith based his advocacy of <i>laissez-faire</i> upon the supposed
identification of public and private interests. He showed how
competition reduced prices to the level of cost of production, how
supply adapted itself to meet demand in a perfectly automatic
fashion, and how capital in an equally natural way flowed into the
most remunerative occupations.</p>

<p>This principle of identity of interests was, however, rudely
shaken by the teachings of Malthus and Ricardo, although both of
them remained strong adherents of the doctrine of individual liberty.</p>

<p>Sismondi, who was the next to intervene, laid stress upon the
evils of competition, and showed how social inequality necessitated
the submission of the weak to the will of the strong. His whole
book was simply a refutation of Smith’s providential optimism.</p>

<p>In Germany even, as early as 1832, that brilliant economist
Hermann was already proceeding with his critical analysis of the
Classical theories; and after demonstrating how frequently individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
interest comes into conflict with public welfare, and how
inadequate is the contribution which it can possibly make to the
general well-being, he declares his inability to subscribe to the
doctrine laid down by most of Smith’s followers, namely, that
individual activity moved by personal interest is sufficient to meet
all the demands of national economy. Within the bounds of this
national economy<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> he thinks there ought to be room for what he
calls the civic spirit (<i>Gemeinsinn</i>) as well.</p>

<p>The next critic, List, bases his whole case upon the opposition
between immediate interests, which guide the individual, and the
permanent interests of the nation, of which the Government alone
can take account.</p>

<p>Stuart Mill, in the famous fifth book of the <i>Principles</i>, refuses
even to discuss the doctrine of identity of interests, believing
it to be quite untenable. On the question of non-intervention
he admits the validity of one economic argument only, namely,
the superiority of self-interest as an economic motive. But he
is quick to recognise its shortcomings and the exceptions to its
universal operation—in the natural incapacity of children and
of the weak-minded, the ignorance of consumers, the difficulty
of achieving it, even when clearly perceived, without the help
of society as a whole, as in the case of the Factory Acts. Mill
also points out how this motive is frequently wanting in modern
industrial organisation, where, for example, we have joint stock
companies acting through the medium of a paid agency, or charitable
work undertaken by an individual who has to consider, not his own
interests, but those of other people. Private interest is also frequently
antagonistic to public interest, as in the case of the public
supply of gas or water, where the individual <i>entrepreneur</i> is influenced
by the thought of a maximum profit rather than by considerations
of general interest. In matters of that kind Stuart Mill was inclined
to favour State intervention.<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>M. Chevalier, from his professorial chair in the Collège de France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
extended his congratulations to Mill upon his successful restoration
of the legitimate duties of Governments.<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> Chevalier thought that
those who believed that the economic order could be set up simply
by the aid of competition acting through personal interest were
either illogical in their arguments or irrational in their aims.
Government was simply the manager of the national organisation,
and its duty was to intervene whenever the general interest was
endangered. But the duties and privileges of government are not
exactly those of the village policeman.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> Applying this principle to
public works, he points out that they are more or less State matters,
and the guarantee for good work is quite as great when the State
itself undertakes to perform it as when it is entrusted to a private
individual.</p>

<p>In 1863 Cournot, whose reputation was unequal to either Mill’s
or Chevalier’s, but whose penetrating thought, despite its small
immediate influence, is quite important in the history of economic
doctrines, treats of the same problem in his <i>Principes de la Théorie
des Richesses</i>. Going straight to the heart of the problem, he asks
whether it is possible to give a clear definition of this general interest—the
economic <i>optimum</i> which we are anxious to realise—and
whether the system of free competition is clearly superior to every
other. He justly remarks that the problem is insoluble. Production
is determined by demand, which depends both upon the
preliminary distribution of wealth and also upon the tastes of
consumers. But if this be the case, it is impossible to outline an
ideal system of distribution or to fix upon the kind of tastes that
will prove most favourable for the development of society. A step
farther and Cournot must have hit upon the distinction so neatly
made by Pareto between maximum utility, which is a variable,
undefined notion, and maximum ophelimity, “the investigation
of which constitutes a clearly defined problem wholly within the
realm of economics.”<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p>But Cournot does not therefore conclude that we ought to
abstain from passing any judgment in the realm of political economy
and abandon all thought of social amelioration. Though the
absolutely best cannot be defined, it does not follow that we cannot
determine the relatively good. “Improvement or amelioration is
possible,” says he, “by introducing a change which operates upon
one part of the economic system, provided there are no indirect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
effects which damage the other parts of the system.”<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> Such
progress is not necessarily the result of private effort. Following
Sismondi, he quotes several instances in which the interests of the
individual collide with those of the public and in which State intervention
might prove useful.</p>

<p>Every one of these authors—in varying degrees, of course—admits
the legitimacy of State intervention in matters economic. Liberty
doubtless is still the fundamental principle. Sismondi was content
with mere aspiration, so great did the difficulties of intervention
appear to him. Stuart Mill thought that the <i>onus probandi</i>
should rest with the innovator. Cournot considered liberty as
being still the most natural and simple method, and should the
State find it necessary to intervene it could only be in those instances
in which science has clearly defined the aim in view and demonstrated
the efficacy of the methods proposed. Every one of them has
abandoned liberty as a scientific principle. To Cournot it was an
axiom of practical wisdom;<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> Stuart Mill upheld it for political
reasons as providing the best method of developing initiative and
responsibility among the citizens. They all agree that the State,
far from being a <i>pis aller</i>, has a legitimate sphere of action. The
difficulty is just to define this.<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> This was the task to which Walras
addressed himself with remarkable success in his lectures on the
theory of the State, delivered in Paris in 1867-68.<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></p>

<p>And so we find that the progress of thought since the days of
Adam Smith had led to important modifications of the old doctrines
concerning the economic functions of the State. The publicists,
however, were not immediately converted. Even when the century
was waning they still remained faithful to the optimistic individualism
of the earlier period. The organon of State Socialism merely
consists of these analyses incorporated into a system. The authors
just mentioned must consequently be regarded, if not as the precursors
of State Socialism, at any rate as unconsciously contributing
to the theory.</p>

<h4 id="heading54">II: THE SOCIALISTIC ORIGIN OF STATE SOCIALISM.
RODBERTUS AND LASSALLE</h4>

<p>State Socialism is not an economic doctrine merely. It has a
social and moral basis, and is built upon a certain ideal of justice
and a particular conception of the function of society and of the
State. This ideal and this conception it received, not from the
economists, but from the Socialists, especially Rodbertus and
Lassalle. The aim of these two writers was to effect a kind of
compromise between the society of the present and that of the
future, using the powers of the modern State simply as a lever.</p>

<p>The idea of a compromise of this kind was not altogether new.
A faint suggestion of it may be detected more than once in the course
of the century, and an experiment of the kind was mooted in France
towards the end of the July Monarchy. At that time we find men
like Louis Blanc and Vidal—who were at least socialists in their
general outlook—writing to demand State intervention not merely
with a view to repairing the injustice of the present society, but also
with a view to preparation for the society of the future with as little
break with the past as possible. Louis Blanc was in this sense the first
to anticipate the programme of the State Socialists. But its more
immediate inspirers were Rodbertus and Lassalle, both of whom
belonged to that country in which its effects were most clearly seen.</p>

<p>Their influence upon German State Socialism cannot be exactly
measured by the amount of direct borrowing that took place. They
were linked by ties of closest friendship to the men who were
responsible for creating and popularising the new ideas, and it is
important that we should appreciate the personal influence which
they wielded. Rodbertus formed the centre of the group, and
during the two years 1862-64 he carried on an active correspondence
with Lassalle. They were brought together by the good
offices of a common friend, Lothar Bucher, an old democrat of 1848
who had succeeded in becoming the confidant of Bismarck. Strangely
enough, Bismarck kept up his friendship with Lassalle even when
the latter was most busily engaged with his propaganda work.<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>
Wagner, also, the most eminent representative of State Socialism,
was in frequent communication with Rodbertus, and he never
failed to recognise his great indebtedness to him. Wagner himself
was on more than one occasion consulted by Bismarck.</p>

<p>But apart altogether from their connection with State Socialism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Rodbertus and Lassalle would deserve a place in our history.
Rodbertus is a theoretical writer of considerable vigour and
eloquence, and his thoughts are extraordinarily suggestive. Lassalle
was an agitator and propagandist rather than an original thinker,
but he has left a lasting impression upon the German labour movement.
Hence our determination to give a somewhat detailed
exposition of their work, especially of that of Rodbertus, and to
spare no effort in trying to realise the importance of the contribution
made by both of them.</p>

<h5 id="heading55">1. <span class="smcap">Rodbertus</span></h5>

<p>In a history of doctrines Rodbertus has a place peculiarly his
own. He forms, as it were, a channel through which the ideas
first preached by Sismondi and the Saint-Simonians were transmitted
to the writers who belong to the last quarter of the century. His
intellectual horizon—largely determined for him by his knowledge of
these French sources<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>—was fixed as early as 1837, when he produced
his <i>Forderungen</i>, which the <i>Gazette universelle d’Augsburg</i> refused to
publish. His first work appeared in 1842,<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> and the earliest of the
<i>Soziale Briefe</i><a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> belong to 1850 and 1851. At the time these passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
almost unnoticed. It was only when Lassalle in his treatise in
1862 referred to him as the greatest of German economists, and
when conservative writers like Rudolf Meyer and Wagner drew
attention to his work, that his books received the notice which
they deserved. The German economists of the last thirty years
have been greatly influenced by him. His ideas, it is true, are
largely those of the earliest French socialists, who wrote before
the movement had lost its purely intellectual tone and become
involved in the struggle of the July Monarchy, but his clear logic
and his systematic method, coupled with his knowledge of economics,
which is in every way superior to that of his predecessors, gives to
these ideas a degree of permanence which they had never enjoyed
before. This “Ricardo of socialism,” as Wagner<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> calls him, did
for his predecessors’ doctrines what Ricardo had succeeded in doing
for those of Malthus and Smith. He magnified the good results of
their work and emphasised their fundamental postulates.</p>

<p>Rodbertus’s upbringing decreed that he should not become
involved in that democratic and radical socialism which was
begotten of popular agitation, and whose best-known representative
is Marx. Marx considered socialism and revolution, economic
theory and political action, as being indissolubly one.<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> Rodbertus,
on the other hand, was a great liberal landowner who sat on the
Left Centre in the Prussian National Assembly of 1848, and his
political faith is summed up in the two phrases “constitutional
government” and “national unity.”<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> The success won by the Bismarckian
policy gradually drew him nearer the monarchy, especially
towards the end of his life.<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> His ideal was a socialist party renouncing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
all political action and confining its attention solely to
social questions. Although personally favourably inclined towards
universal suffrage, he refused to join Lassalle’s <i>Arbeiterverein</i>
because Lassalle had insisted upon placing this article of political
reform on his programme.<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> The party of the future, he thought,
would be at once monarchical, national, and socialistic, or at any
rate conservative and socialistic.<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> At the same time we must
remember that “in so far as the Social Democratic party was aiming
at economic reforms he was with it heart and soul.”<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

<p>Despite his belief in the possibility of reconciling the monarchical
policy with his socialistic programme, he carefully avoided the
economic teachings of the socialists. His too logical mind could
never appreciate their position, and he had the greatest contempt
for the Socialists of the Chair. He would be the first to admit that
in practice socialism must content itself with temporary expedients,
although he cannot bring himself to believe that such compromise
constitutes the whole of the socialistic doctrine. He refers to the
Socialists of the Chair as the “sweetened water thinkers,”<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> and he
refused to join them at the Eisenach Congress of 1872—the “bog
of Eisenach,” as he calls it somewhere. He regarded the whole
thing as a first-class comedy. Even labour legislation, he thought,
was merely a caprice of the humanitarians and socialists.<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> So
that whenever we find him summing up his programme in some
such sonorous phrase as <i>Staat gegen Staatslosigkeit</i><a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> (“the State as
against the No-State”) we must be careful to distinguish it from the
hazy doctrines of the State Socialists.<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> Despite himself, however,
he proved one of the most influential precursors of the school,
and therein lies his real significance.</p>

<p>Rodbertus’s whole theory rests upon the conception of society as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
an organism created by division of labour. Adam Smith, as he points
out, had caught a faint glimmer of the significant fact that all men
are linked together by an inevitable law of solidarity which takes
them out of their isolation and transforms an aggregate of individuals
into a real community having no frontiers and no limits save
such as division of labour imposes, and sufficiently wide in scope to
include the whole universe.<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> As soon as an individual becomes a
part of economic society his well-being no longer depends upon himself
and the use which he makes of the natural medium to which
he applies himself, but upon the activity of his fellow-producers.
The execution of certain social functions, which Rodbertus enumerates
as follows, and which he borrows partly from Saint-Simon,
henceforth become the determining factors: (1) The adaptation of
production to meet demand; (2) the maintenance of production
at least up to the standard of the existing resources; (3) the just
distribution of the common produce among the producers.</p>

<p>Should society be allowed to work out these projects spontaneously,
or should it endeavour to carry out a preconceived plan?
To Rodbertus this was the great problem which society had to
consider. The economists of Smith’s school treated the social
organism as a living thing. The free play of natural laws must have
the same beneficial effects upon it as the free circulation of the
blood has upon the human body. Every social function would
be regularly discharged provided “liberty” only was secured.
Rodbertus thought this was a mistake. “No State,” says he, “is
sufficiently lucky or perhaps unfortunate enough to have the natural
needs of the community satisfied by natural law without any
conscious effort on the part of anyone. The State is an historical
organism, and the particular kind of organisation which it possesses
must be determined for it by the members of the State itself. Each
State must pass its own laws and develop its own organisation.
The organs of the State do not grow up spontaneously. They must
be fostered, strengthened, and controlled by the State.”<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> Hence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
after 1837 we find Rodbertus proposing the substitution of a
system of State direction<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> for the system of natural liberty,
and his whole work is an attempt to justify the introduction
of such a system. Let us examine his thesis and review the
various economic functions which we defined above. Let us also
watch their operation at the present day and see how differently
these functions would be discharged in a better organised community.</p>

<p>1. It is hardly correct to speak of production adapting itself to
social need under existing conditions, because production only
adapts itself to the effective demand, <i>i.e.</i> to the demand when
expressed in terms of money. This fact had been hinted at by
Smith, and Sismondi had laid considerable stress upon it; but
Rodbertus was the earliest to point out that this really meant that
only those people who already possess something can have their
wants satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> Those who have nothing to offer except their
labour, and find that there is no demand for that labour, have no
share in the social product. On the other hand, the individual who
draws an income, even though he never did any work for it, is able
to make effective his demand for the objects of his desire. The
result is that many of the more necessitous persons must needs go
unsatisfied, while others wallow in luxury.</p>

<p>Truer word was never spoken. Rodbertus had a perfect right
to insist on the fundamental fallacy lurking within a system which
could treat unemployment—that modern form of famine—as simply
an over-production of goods, and which found itself unable to
modify it except through public or private charity. His remedy
consisted of a proposal to set up production for social need as a
substitute for production for demand. The first thing to be done
was to find out the time which each individual would be willing to
give to productive work, making a note of the character and quantity
of goods required at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> He thought that “the wants
of men in general form an even series, and that the kind and
number of objects required can easily be calculated.”<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> Knowing
the time which society could afford to give to production, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
would be no great difficulty in distributing the products among the
various producers.</p>

<p>This is to go to work a little too precipitately and to shun the
greatest difficulty of all. The uniform series of wants of which
Rodbertus speaks exist only in the imagination. What we really
find is a small number of collective needs combined with a great
variety of individual needs. Social need is merely a vague term
used to designate both kinds of wants at once. The slightest
reflection shows that every individual possesses quite a unique
series of needs and tastes. To base production upon social need is
to suppress liberty of demand and consumption. It implies the
establishment of an arbitrary scale of needs which must be satisfied
and which is to be imposed upon every individual. The remedy
would be worse than the evil.</p>

<p>But the opposition between social need and effective demand
by no means disposes of his argument. The opposition needs some
proving, and some explanation of the producers’ preference for
demand rather than need ought to be offered. The explanation
must be sought in the fact that the capitalistic producer of to-day
manages his business in accordance with the dictates of personal
interest, and personal interest compels him to apply his instruments
to produce whatever will yield him the largest net product. He is
more concerned about the amount of profit made than about the
amount of produce raised. He produces, not with a view to satisfying
any social need, but simply because it yields him rent or
profit.<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p>This contrast between profit-making and productivity deserves
some attention. Sismondi had already called attention to it by
distinguishing between the net and the gross product. A number
of writers have treated of it since, and it holds a by no means
insignificant place in the history of economic doctrines.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>The opposition is dwelt upon in no equivocal fashion by
Rodbertus. This pursuit of the maximum net product is clearly
the producer’s only guide, but the conclusions which he proceeds
to draw from it are somewhat more questionable. If we accept
his opinion that the satisfaction of social need and not of individual
demand is the determining factor in production, we are driven to
the conclusion that modern society, actuated as it is by this one
motive, cannot possibly satisfy every individual demand. But we
have already shown that the phrase “social need” has no precise
connotation; neither has the term “productivity,” which is so
intimately connected with it. Further, if society has no desire to
impose upon its members an arbitrary scale of wants that must be
satisfied—in other words, if demand and consumption are to remain
free—it can only be by adopting that system which recognises a
difference between the present and the future “rentability” of the
product. This difference between the sale price and the real cost
of production of any commodity must, it seems to us, be recognised
even by a collectivist society as the only method of knowing whether
the satisfaction which a commodity gives is in any way commensurate
with the labour involved in its production.<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> Pareto has given
an excellent demonstration of this by showing how collectivist society
will have to take account of price indications if social demand is to
be at all adequately supplied.</p>

<p>2. Turning to the other desideratum, namely, a fuller utilisation
of the means of production, Rodbertus contents himself with
quoting the criticisms of the Saint-Simonians concerning the absence
of conscious direction which characterises the present <i>régime</i> and
the hereditary element which is such a common feature of economic
administration. He is in full agreement with Sismondi when the
latter declares that production is entirely at the option of the
capitalist proprietor.<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> In this matter he is content merely to follow
his leaders, without making any contribution of his own to the
subject.</p>

<p>3. There still remains a third economic function which society
ought to perform, and which Rodbertus considered the most
important of all, namely, the distribution of the social product.
An analysis of the present system of distribution was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
tasks he had set himself to accomplish, believing with Sismondi and
other socialists that a solution of the problem of distribution and
the explanation of such phenomena as economic crises and pauperism
constitute the most vital problems which face the science at the
present moment.</p>

<p>A just distribution, in Rodbertus’s opinion, should secure to
everyone the product of his labour.<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> But does not the present
<i>régime</i> of free competition and private property accomplish this?</p>

<p>Let us watch the mechanism of distribution as we find it
operating at the present time. Rodbertus’s description of it is not
very different from J. B. Say’s, and it tallies pretty closely with
the Classical scheme. On the one hand we have the <i>entrepreneur</i>
who purchases the services of labour, land, and capital, and sells
the product which results from this collaboration. The prices
which he pays for these services and the price he himself receives
from the consumer are determined by the interaction of demand
and supply. What remains after paying wages, interest, and rent
constitutes his profits.<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a></p>

<p>The distribution of the product is effected through the mechanism
of exchange, and the result of its operation is to secure to the owner
of every productive service the approximate market value of that
service. Could anything be juster? Apparently not. But if we
examine the social and economic hinterland behind this mechanism
what we do find is the callous exploitation of the worker by every
capitalist and landlord. The various commodities which are
distributed among the different beneficiaries are really the products
of labour. They are begotten of effort and toil—largely mechanical.
Rodbertus did not under-value intellectual work or under-estimate
the importance of directive energy. But intelligent effort seemed
to him an almost inexhaustible force, and its employment should
cost nothing, just as the forces of nature may be got for nothing.
Only manual labour implies loss of time and energy—the sacrifice
of something that cannot be replaced.<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> Consequently he does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
recognise the intellectual or moral effort (the name is immaterial)
involved in the postponement of consumption, whereby a present
good is withheld with a view to contributing to the sum total of
future good.<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> And he proceeds to define and to develop the
opening paragraph of Smith’s <i>Wealth of Nations</i>: “The annual
labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with
all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes,
and which consist always either in the immediate produce
of that labour or in what is purchased with that produce from other
nations.”</p>

<p>The difference between his attitude and Marx’s is also interesting.
Marx was thoroughly well versed in political economy, and had
made a special study of the English socialists. His one object was
to set up a new theory of exchange, with labour as the source of all
value. Rodbertus, who drew his inspiration from the Saint-Simonians,
focused attention upon production, and treated labour
as the real source of every product—a simpler, a truer, but a still
incomplete proposition. Rodbertus never definitely commits himself
to saying that labour by itself creates value, but, on the other
hand, he never denies it.<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> Social progress, he always maintained,
must consist in the greater degree of coincidence<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> between the value
of a product and the quantity of labour contained in it. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
is a task which the future must take in hand.<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Again, if it be true
that the worker creates the product, but that the proprietors of the
soil and the capitalists who have had no share in its production are
able to manipulate exchange in such a way as to retain a portion of it
for themselves, it is clear that our judgment concerning the equity of
the present system needs some revision. This secret embezzlement
for the profit of the non-worker and to the injury of the diligent
proceeds without any outward display of violence through the
free play of exchange operating within a system of private property.
Its sole cause lies in the present social system, “which recognises the
claim of private landowners and capitalists to a share of the wealth
distributed, although they have contributed nothing towards its
production.”<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<p>Hence his exposition of the twofold aspect of distribution.
Economically exchange attributes to each of the factors land,
capital, and labour a portion of the produce corresponding to the
value of their respective services as estimated in the market. Socially
it often means taking away from the real producers—from the
workers—a part of the goods which their toil has created. This
portion Rodbertus refers to under the simple name “rent,” which
includes both the revenue of capitalists and the income of landlords.</p>

<p>No economist ever put the twofold aspect of the problem in a
clearer light. Laying hold of the eternal opposition between the
respective standpoints, he emphasises the difficulties which they
present to so many minds. Justice would relate distribution to
merit, but society is indifferent provided its own needs are satisfied.
Society simply takes account of the market value of these products
and services without ever showing the least concern for their origin
or the efforts which they may originally have involved—the weary
day of the industrious labourer and the effortless lounge of the
lazy capitalist being similarly rewarded. Rodbertus’s great merit
was to separate this truth from the other issues so frequently confused
with it in the writings of the earlier economists and to bring it
clearly before the notice of his fellow economists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodbertus’s criticism did not end there, although the demonstration
which we have just given of the distinction between the
social and the purely economic point of approach to distribution
constitutes its essential merit. We must not omit the practical
conclusions which he draws from it.</p>

<p>What concerned Rodbertus most—at least, so we imagine from
the standpoint which he adopted—was not the particular way
in which the rate of wages or interest, high or low rents, are
determined, but the proportion of the revenue that goes to the
workers and non-workers respectively. The former question is
a purely economic one of quite secondary importance compared
with this other social problem. Believing that he had already
shown the possibility of the workers being robbed, the problem
now was to determine whether this spoliation was likely to continue.
Does economic progress give any ground for hoping that rent or
unearned income will gradually disappear? Bastiat and Carey had
replied in the affirmative. The proportion that goes to capital,
so they affirmed, is gradually becoming less, to the great advantage
of the labourer. Ricardo, faced with the same dilemma, had
come to the conclusion that with the inevitable increase in the
cost of producing food the landowner’s share must be constantly
growing. Say had asked himself the same question in the earliest
edition of his treatise, but had found no reply. Rodbertus adopts
none of their solutions, but independently arrives at the conclusion
that the worker’s share gradually dwindles, to the advantage
of the other participants.<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>Theorist as he was, a simple deduction was all that was
needed to convince him of the truth of this view. The rate of
wages, we have already seen, is determined by the interaction of
demand and supply in the labour market. The market price of
labour, however, like that of any other product, is always gravitating
towards a normal value—this normal value being none other than
Ricardo’s necessary wage. “The share of the product that falls to
the lot of the producer both in an individual instance and as a
general rule is not measured by the amount which he himself has
produced, but by that quantity which is sufficient for the upkeep
of his strength and the upbringing of his children.”<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> This celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
“brazen law” became the pivot of Lassalle’s propaganda,
although it was never definitely recognised by Marx.</p>

<p>Granting the existence of such a law, and admitting also that
the amount produced by labour is always increasing, so that the
mass of commodities produced always keeps growing, a very simple
arithmetical calculation suffices to show that the total quantity
obtained by the workers always remains the same, representing a
diminished fraction of the growing totality.</p>

<p>A similar demonstration affords a clue to the prevalence of
crises. The <i>entrepreneur</i> keeps adding to the mass of commodities
produced until he touches the full capacity of social demand.<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
But while production grows and expands the worker’s share dwindles,
and thus his demand for some products remains permanently below
production level. The structure is giving way under the very feet
of the unsuspecting producer.<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> This theory of crises is simply a
re-echo of Sismondi,<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> and gives an explanation of a chronic evil
rather than of a crisis pure and simple. Its scientific value is just
about equal to Sismondi’s other theory concerning proportional
distribution.</p>

<p>This theory upon which Rodbertus laid such emphasis had
already been outlined in his <i>Forderungen</i>, and a fuller development
is given in his <i>Soziale Briefe</i>, where he expressly states it to be the
fundamental point of his whole system, all else being mere scaffolding.
His one ambition all his life long was to be able to give a
statistical proof of it, but its importance is not nearly as great as he
imagined it to be.</p>

<p>In the first place, doubt as to the validity of the “brazen” or
“iron law of wages”—upon which the theory is based—is entertained
not merely by economists, but also by socialists. And even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
if it were true, Rodbertus’s proof would still be inconclusive, for the
workers’ share of the total product depends not upon one fact alone,
but upon two—the rate of wages <i>and</i> the number of workers. Rodbertus’s
error and Bastiat’s are very similar. Bastiat had tried to
determine the capitalists’ share of the total product by taking
account of one fact only, namely, the rate of interest, whereas he
ought to have taken the amount of existing capital into consideration
as well.</p>

<p>But we must admit that although the arguments used by
Rodbertus are scarcely more reliable than Bastiat’s, his theory
itself is nearer the facts as judged by statistics. No amount of
<i>a priori</i> reasoning without some recourse to statistics can ever solve
the problem. Statistics themselves seem to prove that labour’s
portion, in some countries at least, has shown signs of diminishing
since the beginning of the present century.</p>

<p>This does not necessarily mean that the worker must be worse
off, for it may well happen that a diminution in the general share
obtained by labour is accompanied by a growth of individual wages.
All that we can conclude is that wages have not increased as rapidly
as has capital’s share,<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> but this has not prevented the workers
sharing in the general growth of prosperity.</p>

<p>Logically enough, Rodbertus proceeds to draw certain practical
conclusions, including the necessity for the suppression of private
property and of individual production. The community should be
the sole owner of the means of production. Unearned income must
go. Everyone should contribute something to the national dividend,
and each should share in the total produce in proportion to his
labour. The value of all commodities will depend upon the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
of time spent on them and effort put into them; and since the supply
will always adapt itself to the needs of society the measure will be
constant and exact, and equal distribution will be assured.</p>

<p>But Rodbertus recoils from his own solution, and the ardent
socialist becomes a simple State Socialist. What frightens him is
not the terrible tyranny of a system under which production and
even consumption would be strictly regulated. “There would be
as much personal freedom under a system of this kind as in any
other form of society,” he remarks,<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> “society” evidently always
implying some measure of restraint. His apprehension was of
a different kind. He had a perfect horror of any revolutionary
change, and stood aghast at the lack of education displayed by the
masses. He realised how unwilling they were to sacrifice even a
part of their wages in order to enable other men to have the necessary
leisure to pursue the study of the arts and sciences—the noblest
fruits of civilisation. Finally it seemed to him that illegal appropriation
and the rightful ownership which results from vigorous toil
are too often confused by being indiscriminately spoken of as
private property. “There is,” says he, “so much that is right
mixed up with what is wrong that one goads the lawful owner into
revolt in trying to lay hold of the unlawful possessor.”<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

<p>Some kind of compromise should at all costs be effected. If
private property—one of the great evils of the present day—cannot
be got rid of without some inconvenience, cannot we possibly
dispense with freedom of contract, the other source of inequality?
Let us assume, then, that we have got rid of free contract while
retaining the institution of private property. By doing this,
although we are not immediately able to clear away unearned
income, we shall have removed some of the greatest inconveniences
that result from it. We shall arrest the downward trend of labour’s
remuneration, and poverty and crises will disappear together.<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>Such an attempt might be made even now. Let the State
estimate the total value of the social product in terms of labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
and determine the fraction that should go to the workers. Let it
give to each <i>entrepreneur</i> in accordance with the number of workers
he employs a number of wage coupons, in return for which the
<i>entrepreneur</i> shall be obliged to put on the market a quantity of
commodities equal in value. Lastly, let the said workers, paid in
wage coupons, supply themselves with whatever they want from
the public stores in return for these coupons. The national estimate
would from time to time be subject to revision; and in order that
the proportions should always be the same, the number of coupons
given to labour would have to be increased if the number of commodities
produced ever happened to increase. Rodbertus’s aim
was to give the workers a share in the general progress made, and
such was the plan which he laid down.<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p>There is no need to emphasise its theoretical, let alone its
practical difficulties. We were led to mention it for a double
reason. In the first place, it is interesting as an attempt to effect
a compromise between the society of the present and the collectivism
of the future. Marx regards the growing servility of the worker
with a certain measure of equanimity as a necessary preliminary
to his final emancipation. Rodbertus would speed the process of
amelioration and would better his lot here and now.<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> It also
throws an interesting light upon his extraordinary confidence in the
all-powerful sovereignty of the State, and the ability of government
to bend every individual will, even the most recalcitrant, to the
general will. At the same time it reveals his utter indifference to
individual liberty as an economic motive.</p>

<p>This indifference gradually merges into extreme hostility, while
his confidence in the centralised executive becomes all the more
thoroughly established. His later historical works contain an
exposition of an organic theory of the State which is meant to
justify such confidence. Just as in the animal world the higher
animals are found to possess the most highly differentiated organs
as well as the most closely co-ordinated, so in history as we
pass from the lower social strata to the higher ones “the State
advances both in magnitude and efficiency; and its action, while
increasing in scope, grows in intensity as well. The State in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
passage from one evolutionary stage to another presents us not
merely with a greater degree of complexity, each function being to
a greater and greater extent discharged by some special organ, but
also with an increasing degree of harmony. The social organisms,
despite their ever-increasing variation, are placed in growing dependence
upon one another by being linked to some central organ. In
other words, the particular grade that a social organism occupies in
the organic hierarchy depends upon the degree to which division of
labour and centralisation have been carried.”<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a></p>

<p>We are thus driven back upon the fundamental question set by
Rodbertus at the outset of his inquiry: Can the various social
functions, acting spontaneously, efficiently further the good of the
social body, or should these functions be discharged by the mediation
of a special organ, the State or Government? There is also
the further question as to whether the reply which he gives is entirely
satisfactory.</p>

<p>We are immediately struck by a preliminary contradiction:
the economic boundaries of the community do not coincide with its
political boundaries. The one is the result of division of labour
and is coextensive with the limits set by division of labour, while
the second is the product of the changing conditions of history. It
is only logical that the economic functions of the State should be
performed by other organs than those of the political Government,
since its sphere of action is necessarily different. But it is to the
State, as evolved in the course of a long historical process, that
Rodbertus would entrust this directing power. Between Rodbertus’s
description of the State’s economic activity and his final recourse to
a national monarchical State is an element of contradiction which
strikes us rather forcibly, especially when he comes to speak of
“national” socialism.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate how inadequately the present social
organisation performs its duties, Rodbertus appeals to an ideal method
of discharging them which he himself has created, and he has not
the slightest difficulty in showing that hardly any of his ideal
functions are being performed at the present time. Production is
not based upon social need, nor is the wealth produced distributed
in accordance with the labour spent. But we must never forget
that Rodbertus’s conception of the social need was extremely
hazy. His distribution formula, “to everyone according as he
produces,” if applied logically is impossible, and satisfies neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
the demands of humanity nor the needs of production. Had his
definition of social function been less ambitious, his argument,
perhaps, would have been more convincing.</p>

<p>Let us admit, however, that the existence of an economic society
implies the successful accomplishment of certain functions which
we need not trouble to define just now. The question then arises—a
question that implies the severest criticism of the present organisation:
Can the control and oversight which men ought to exercise
over these functions be performed otherwise than through the
instrumentality of the State? There was only one alternative for
Rodbertus—extreme individualism or State control. But nature
and history both escape the dilemma. The biological analogy
has been carried too far, and most writers would be content to
abandon it altogether. Like most of his contemporaries, Rodbertus
imagined that economic individualism and personal liberty were
indissolubly bound together, and that it was impossible to check
individualism without endangering liberty. It is now realised,
however, that this association of ideas, like many another, is temporary
and not eternal, and the growth of voluntary associations
intermediate between the State and the individual is every day
showing it to be false.</p>

<p>We are now in a better position to appreciate the kind of appeal
which this doctrine would make to State Socialists—people who are
essentially conservative, but nevertheless genuinely desirous of
seeing a larger element of justice introduced into our industrial
<i>régime</i>. The distinction drawn between politics and economic
socialism makes a first claim upon their respect. Then would follow
the organic conception of society, which is a feature of all Rodbertus’s
writings. It was his belief that production and distribution could
only be regarded as social functions, and that the breakdown of
individualism implied a need for greater centralisation or a greater
degree of State control. On the other hand, the State Socialists
refuse to associate themselves with the radical condemnation of
private property and unearned income, both of which are features
of Rodbertus’s teaching. The State Socialists set out to transform
the Rodbertian compromise into a self-sufficing system, and instead
of regarding their doctrine as a diluted form of socialism they are
rather inclined to treat socialism as an exaggerated development of
their theory.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<h5 id="heading56">2. <span class="smcap">Lassalle</span></h5>

<p>Rodbertus’s efforts to establish a doctrine of State Socialism
upon the firm foundation of a new social theory had already met
with a certain measure of success, but it was reserved for Lassalle
to infuse vitality into these new ideas.</p>

<p>Lassalle’s brief but brilliant political career, ever memorable for
the natural vigour of his eloquence, at once popular and refined, and
its indelible impression of a strikingly original nature aflame with a
passion both for thought and action, together with the romantic,
dramatic character of his checkered existence, lent wonderful force
to his utterances. In 1848, at the early age of twenty-three, he
was a Marxian revolutionist. The revolutionary period was
followed by a time of enforced inactivity, when he devoted himself
almost exclusively to philosophical, legal, and literary pursuits.
In 1862 the silence was at last broken by his re-entry into the
political arena. The whole political life of Germany was at that
moment convulsed by the half-hearted opposition which the
Prussian Liberal party was offering to Bismarck’s constitutional
changes. Lassalle declared war both upon the Government and
upon the <i>bourgeois</i> Opposition—upon the latter more than the
former, perhaps. Turning to the working classes, he urged them
to form a new party which would avoid all purely political questions
and to concentrate upon their own economic emancipation. For
two eventful years the whole of Germany resounded with his speeches
and his declamations before various tribunals, while the country
was flooded with his pamphlets advocating the complete establishment
of the <i>Allgemeiner deutscher Arbeiterverein</i> (General Association
of German Workers), which he had already founded at Leipzig in
1863. The workers of the Rhineland received with open arms the
agitator who thus took up in their midst the tangled skein of a
broken career, and welcomed him with songs and decked him with
garlands. The Liberal press, on the other hand, thoroughly taken
aback by his unexpected onslaughts, mercilessly attacked him, even
accusing him of having secret dealings with the Government.
Suddenly the clamour ceased: Lassalle died on August 31, 1864, as
the result of a wound which he had received in a duel,<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> and only the
<i>Deutscher Arbeiterverein</i>, the earliest embryo of the great German
Social Democratic party, remained as a memento of those violent
attacks upon individualist Liberalism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>As far as theory goes, Lassalle’s socialism is hardly distinguishable
from Marx’s. Social evolution is summed up in a stricter limitation
of the rights of private property,<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> which in the course of a century
or two must result in its total disappearance.<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> But Lassalle was
pre-eminently a man of action, bent upon practical results. At
that particular moment the German working class was only just
waking up to the possibility of political existence. The path that
it should follow was still undecided. In the year 1863 a number of
workmen had tried to persuade their comrades to meet together
in a kind of general congress. They further appealed to Lassalle
and to other well-known democrats for their advice concerning
the labour question. This gave Lassalle the opportunity he
required for forming a political party of his own, with himself as
chief. The next question was to fix upon a programme. “Working
men,” says Lassalle, “must have something definite,”<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> and, on the
other hand, “it is almost impossible to get the public to understand
the final object which we must keep in view.”<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> So, without burdening
his propaganda with too remote an ideal, he concentrates all his
efforts upon two demands, the one political, the other economic—universal
suffrage on the one hand and the establishment of producers’
associations supported by the State on the other. In order to win
over the masses, he invoked, not the doctrine of the exploitation of the
workers by the proprietors—which would have alienated the middle
classes from him<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>—but the “brazen law of wages,” which is the happy
title by which he chose to designate the Ricardian law of wages.</p>

<p>Rodbertus realised the necessity for distinguishing between an
esoteric and an exoteric Lassalle<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>—between the logical theorist of
the study and the opportunist politician of the public platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>.
Only to his contemporaries was the latter Lassalle really known.
But his letters, which have been published since his death, go to
show that there is at least no need to attach any greater importance
to his proposed reforms than he was prepared to give them himself.
It is not necessary to emphasise the fact that his plan was really
borrowed from Louis Blanc or to call attention to the letter written
to Rodbertus in which he declares himself quite prepared to change
his plan provided a better one can be found. This idea of association
was one that was by no means unknown to the German Liberal
party; nor was it the first time that it had been preached to the
working classes. Lassalle’s rival, Schulze-Delitzsch, had begun an
active campaign even as far back as 1849, and had succeeded in
establishing a great number of co-operative credit societies, composed
largely of artisans, and aiming at supplying them with cheap raw
materials. But such associations were to receive no support from
the Government.</p>

<p>What was new in Lassalle’s scheme was just this appeal for
State intervention. It was his energetic protest against eternal
<i>laissez-faire</i> that impressed public opinion, and he himself was anxious
that it should be presented in this light. Speaking to the workers
of Frankfort on May 19, 1863, he declared that “State intervention
is the one question of principle involved in this campaign.
That is the consideration that has weighed with me, and there lies
the whole issue of the battle which I am about to wage.”<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a></p>

<p>He harks back to this fundamental idea in all his principal
writings. It was the theme of his first address delivered to the
workers in Berlin in 1862. It is there presented with all his customary
force. The <i>bourgeois</i> conception of the State is contrasted
with the true conception, which is identical with the workers’.
The <i>bourgeoisie</i> seem to think that the State has nothing to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
except to protect the property and defend the liberties of the
individual—a conception of State action that would be quite
sufficient were everybody equally strong and intelligent, equally
cultured and equally rich.<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> But where such equality does not
exist the State is reduced to the position of a “night watchman,”
and the weak is left at the mercy of the strong. In reality the
State exists for quite other purposes. The history of mankind is the
story of one long struggle to establish liberty in the face of natural
forces, to overcome oppression of every kind, and to triumph over the
misery, ignorance, want, and weakness with which human nature
has always had to reckon. In that struggle the individual, in his
isolation, is hopeless and union becomes indispensable. This union
is a creation of the State, and its object is to realise the destiny of
mankind, namely, the attainment of the highest degree of culture
of which humanity is capable. It is a means of educating and of
furthering the development of humanity along the path of liberty.</p>

<p>The formula savours of metaphysics rather than of economics.
There is a striking similarity between it and the formula employed
by Hegel, the philosopher.<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> Lassalle was really a disciple of Hegel
and Fichte.<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> Through the influence of Lassalle the theories of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
German idealists came into conflict with the economists’, and his
incomparable eloquence contributed not a little to the rising tide of
indignation with which the Manchester ideas came to be regarded.</p>

<h4 id="heading57">III: STATE SOCIALISM—PROPERLY SO CALLED</h4>

<p>The years that elapsed between the death of Lassalle and the
Congress of Eisenach (1872) proved to be the decisive period in
the formation of German State Socialism.</p>

<p>Bismarck’s remarkable <i>coups d’état</i> in 1866 and 1870 had done
much to discredit the political reputation of the leaders of the
Liberal party, who had shown themselves less than a match for the
Chancellor’s political insight. This reacted somewhat upon
economic Liberalism, because it so happened that the leaders of
both parties were the same.<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> On the other hand, the idea of a
rejuvenated empire incarnate in the Iron Chancellor seemed to
add fresh lustre to the whole conception of the State. The <i>Jahrbücher
für Nationalökonomie</i>, first issued by the Historical school in
1863, had by this time become the recognised organ of the University
Economists, and had done a great deal to accustom men’s minds
to the relative character of the principles of political economy and
to prepare their thoughts for an entirely new point of view.</p>

<p>Labour questions had also suddenly assumed an importance
quite undreamt of before this. The German revolution of 1848 was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
presumably political in character: the great capitalistic industry
had not reached that stage of development which characterised it
both in England and in France; and it is a significant fact that
the two great German socialists, Rodbertus and Marx, had to go
abroad to either of those two countries to get their illustrations.
But since 1848 German industry had made great strides. A new
working-class community had come into being, and Lassalle had
further emphasised this transformation by seeking to found a party
exclusively upon this new social stratum. The association which
was thus founded still survives. Another agitation, largely inspired
by Marxian ideas, was begun about the same time by Liebknecht
and Bebel. In 1867 both of them were elected to the Reichstag,
and two years later they founded the <i>Socialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei</i>
(Social Democratic party), which was destined to play
such an important part in the history of the next thirty years.</p>

<p>In this way labour questions suddenly attracted attention, just
as they had previously done in France during the July Monarchy;
and just as in France a new current of opinion—unceremoniously
set aside by the <i>coup d’état</i>, it is true—had urged upon the educated
classes the importance of abandoning the doctrine of absolute
<i>laissez-faire</i> and of claiming the support of Government in the
struggle with poverty, so in Germany an increasing number of
authors had persuaded themselves that a purely passive attitude
in face of the serious nature of the social problem which confronted
them was impossible, and that the establishment of some sort of
compact between the warring forces of capital and labour should
not prove too much of an undertaking for the rejuvenated vitality
of a new empire.</p>

<p>The new tendencies revealed themselves in unmistakable fashion
at Eisenach in 1872. A conference, which was largely composed of
professors and economists, of administrators and jurists, decided
upon the publication of a striking manifesto in which they declared
war upon the Manchester school. The manifesto spoke of the State
as “a great moral institution for the education of humanity,” and
claimed that it should be “animated by a high moral ideal,” which
would “enable an increasing number of people to participate in the
highest benefits of civilisation.”<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> At the same time the members
of the congress determined upon the establishment of the <i>Verein
für Sozialpolitik</i>, an association charged with the task of procuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
the necessary scientific material for this new political development.
This was the beginning of the “Socialism of the Chair,” as it was
derisively named by the Liberals on account of the great number
of professors who took part in this conference. The same doctrine,
with a somewhat more radical bias, became known as State Socialism.
The imparting of such a bias was the task undertaken by Wagner,<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>
in his <i>Grundlegung</i>, which appeared in 1876.<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></p>

<p>Difficult though the task may prove, we must try to distinguish
between the work of the earlier economists and the special contributions
made by the State Socialists. Like all doctrines that
purport to sum up the aspirations of a group or an epoch and to
supply a working agreement between principles in themselves
irreconcilable, it lacks the definiteness of a purely individualistic or
theoretical system. Its ideas are borrowed from various sources,
but it is not always scrupulous in recognising this.</p>

<p>It is first and foremost a reaction, not against the fundamental
ideas of the English Classical school, as is generally believed, but
against the exaggerations of their second-grade disciples, the admirers
of Bastiat and Cobden—known to us as the “Optimists” and
styled the “Manchestrians” in Germany. The manifesto, drawn
up by Professor Schmoller at the Eisenach Congress, speaks of
the “Manchester school,” but makes no mention of the Classical
writers.<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> It is true that a great many German writers regard
the expressions “Smithianismus” and “Manchesterthum” as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
synonymous, but these are perhaps polemical exaggerations upon
which we ought not to lay too much stress. On the other hand,
Liberalism had nowhere assumed such extravagant proportions as
it had in Germany. Prince Smith, who is the best-known representative
of Liberalism after Dunoyer, was convinced that the
State had nothing to do beyond guaranteeing security, and denied
that there was any element of solidarity between economic agents
save such as results from the existence of a common market. “The
economic community, as such, is a community built upon the
existence of a market, and it has no facility to offer other than
free access to a market.”<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<p>The State Socialists, on the contrary, are of opinion that
there exists a moral solidarity which is much more fundamental
than any economic tie between the various individuals and classes
of the same nation—such solidarity as results from the possession
of a common language, similar manners, and a uniform political
constitution. The State is the organ of this moral solidarity, and
because of this title it has no right to remain indifferent to the
material poverty of a part of the nation. It has something to do
besides protecting people against internal or external violence. It
has a real work of “civilisation and well-being”<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> which it ought
to perform. In this way State Socialism becomes reconciled to the
philosophic standpoint which Lassalle had chosen for it. Lassalle’s
insistence upon the mission of Governments and the importance
of their historic <i>rôle</i> has been incorporated into its system, and
the attention that is paid to national considerations reminds one
of the teaching of Friedrich List.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to ask whether the State is capable of carrying
out the duties that have been entrusted to it. There is little use in
emphasising duty where there is no capacity for discharging it.
The State’s incapacity as an economic agent has long been a notorious
fact. Wagner and his friends were particularly anxious to correct
this false impression, and as far as their doctrine contains anything
original it may most conveniently be described as an attempt to
rehabilitate the State. Optimists of Bastiat’s genre looked upon
the State as the very incarnation of incapacity. The State Socialists,
on the other hand, regard government as an economic agent very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
similar to other agents which the community employs, only a little
more sympathetic perhaps. Much of their argument consists of an
attempt to create a presumption in favour of government as against
the ordinarily accepted opinion which individualism had begotten.
Such was the nature of the task which they undertook.</p>

<p>Their first action was to insist upon the weaknesses of individuals.
Following in the wake of Sismondi and other socialists, they
emphasised the social inconveniences of competition, which is,
however, generally confused with individual liberty.<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> They also
insisted upon the social inequality of masters and workers when it
comes to a question of wage-bargaining—a fact that had already
been noted by Adam Smith—as well as upon the universal opposition
that exists between the weak and the strong. The inadequacy of
merely individual effort to satisfy certain collective wants is another
fact that was considerably emphasised.</p>

<p>As far back as the year 1856 Dupont-White, a Frenchman,
had complained bitterly that all the paths of civilisation remained
closed merely because of the existence of one obstacle—the infirmity
and malignity of the individual.<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> He also attempted to show how
the collective interests of modern society are becoming increasingly
complex in character and of such magnitude as to be utterly beyond
the compass of individual thought.<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> “There are,” says he in that
excellent formula in which he summarises the instances in which
State intervention may be necessary, “certain vital things which
the individual can never do, either because he has not the necessary
strength to perform them or because they would not pay him; or,
again, because they require the co-operation of everybody, which
can never be got merely by common consent. The State is the one
person—the <i>entrepreneur</i>—who can undertake such tasks.”<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> But
his words went unheeded.</p>

<p>Writing in a similar vein, Wagner invokes the testimony of
history in support of his State doctrine, showing us how the State’s
functions vary from one period to another, so that one never feels
certain about prescribing limits to its action. Individual interest,
private charity, and the State have always had to divide the
field of activity between them. Never has the first of these, taken
by itself, proved sufficient, and in all the great modern states its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
place is taken by State action. To conclude that this solution
was useful and necessary and in accordance with the true law of
historical development only involved one further step.<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> One
almost unconsciously proceeds from the mere statement of a fact
to the definite formulation of a law. “Anyone,” says Wagner,
“who has appreciated the immanent tendencies of evolution (<i>i.e.</i>
the essential features of economic, social, or political evolution)
may very properly proceed from such a historical conception of
social evolution to the formulation of postulates relative to what
ought to be.”<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> In virtue of this conception there is a demand for
the extension of the State’s functions, which may easily be justified
on the ground of its capacity for furthering the well-being and civilisation
of the community. The influence of Rodbertus’s thought,
especially his theory concerning the development of governmental
organs to meet the needs of a higher social development,<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> is quite
unmistakable in this connection.</p>

<p>The similarity between his views and those of Dupont-White,
though entirely fortuitous, perhaps, is sufficiently remarkable to
justify our calling attention to it. White is equally emphatic in
his demand that the State should exercise charity and act beneficently.<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>
He shows how the modern State has extended its
dominion, substituting local government for class dominion and
parental despotism, taking women, children, and slaves successively
under its care, and adding to its duties and responsibilities in
proportion as civilisation grows and liberty broadens downward.
Fresh life requires more organs, new forces demand new regulations.
But the ruler and the organ of society is the State.<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> In a moment
of enthusiasm he even goes so far as to declare that “the State
is simply man minus his passions; man at such a stage of development
that he can commune even with truth itself, fearing neither
God nor his own conscience. However imperfect it may be, the
State is still vastly superior to the individual.”<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> Such writing is
not without a touch of mysticism.</p>

<p>Without going the extent of admitting, as M. Wagner would
have us do, that the simple demonstration of the truth of historical
evolution is enough to justify his policy, we must commend State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
Socialism for the service it has performed in combating the Liberal
contempt for government. If we admit the right of a central
power to regulate social relations, it is difficult to understand
why certain economic relations only should be subjected to such
supervision.</p>

<p>But the real difficulty, even when the principle is fully recognised,
is to define the spheres that should respectively belong to the State
and to the individual. How far, within what limits, and according
to what rules should the State intervene? We must at any rate,
as Wagner says, begin with a rough distribution of attributes. It
is impossible to proceed by any other method unless we are to
assume, as the collectivists seem to do, a radical change in human
psychology resulting in the complete substitution of a solicitude
for the public welfare for private interest.</p>

<p>Dupont-White thought the problem insoluble,<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> and Wagner is
equally emphatic about the impossibility of formulating an absolute
rule. The statesman must decide each case on its merits. He
does, however, lay down a few general rules. As a first general
principle it is clear that the State can never completely usurp the
place of the individual.<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> It can only concern itself with the general
conditions of his development. The personal activity of the individual
must for ever remain the essential spring of economic progress.
The principle is apparently the same as Stuart Mill’s, but there is
quite a marked difference between them. Mill wished to curtail
individual effort as little as possible, Wagner to extend Government
action as much as he could. Mill insists throughout upon the negative
<i>rôle</i> of Government; Wagner emphasises the positive side, and
claims that it should help an ever-increasing proportion of the
population to share in the benefits of civilisation. No inconvenience,
Wagner thinks, would result from a little more communism in our
social life. “National economy should be transferred from the control
of the individual to the control of the community in general,”
he writes, in a sentence that might have been borrowed directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
from Rodbertus.<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> Both he and Mill are agreed that the limit of Government
action must be placed just at that point where it threatens to
cramp individual development.<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a></p>

<p>The practical application of these ideas would affect both the
production and the distribution of wealth. But on this question
State Socialism has done little more than seize hold of ideas that
were current long before its day.</p>

<p>In the matter of distribution it takes exactly the same standpoint
as Sismondi. There is no condemnation either of profits or
interest as a matter of principle, such as is the case with the Socialists,
nor is there any suggestion of doing away with private property as
the fundamental institution of society; but there is the expression
of a desire for a more exact correspondence between income and
effort<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> and for such a limitation of profits as the economic conjuncture
will allow of, and, on the other hand, for such an increase
of wages as will permit of a more humane existence. It is impossible
to disguise the fact that all this sounds very vague.<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p>The State would thus undertake to see that distribution conformed
to the moral sentiment of each period. Taxation was to be
employed as the instrument of such reforms. Dupont-White, in
his <i>Capital et Travail</i>,<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> which was written as early as the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
1847, had hit upon the precise formula in which to describe these
projects: “To levy a tax such as will strike the higher classes and
to apply the yield to help and reward labour.” Wagner says just
the same thing. “Logically State Socialism must undertake two
tasks which are closely connected with one another. In the first
place it must raise the lower strata of the working classes at the
expense of the higher classes, and in the second place it must put
a check upon the excessive accumulation of wealth among certain
strata of society or by certain members of the propertied classes.”<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></p>

<p>In the matter of production State Socialism has simply been
content to reproduce the list given by Mill, Chevalier, and Cournot
of the cases in which there is no economic principle against the
direct control or management of an industrial enterprise by the
State. Speaking generally, Wagner is of the opinion that the State
should take upon itself the control of such industries as are of a
particularly permanent or universal character, or such as require
either uniform or specialised methods of control or are likely to
become monopolies in the hands of private individuals. The same
argument would apply to industries satisfying some general want,
but in which it is almost impossible to determine the exact advantage
which the consumer derives from them. The State administration
of rivers, forests, roads, and canals, the nationalisation of railways
and banks, and the municipalisation of water and gas, are justified
on the same grounds.</p>

<p>Such are the essential features of State Socialism, which bases its
appeal, not on any precise criticism of property or of unearned
income, such as we are accustomed to get from the socialists, but
entirely upon moral and national considerations. A juster distribution
of wealth and a higher well-being for the working classes
appear to be the only methods of maintaining that national unity
of which the State is the representative. But it neither specifies
the rules of justice nor indicates the limits of the ameliorative
process. The fostering of collective effort affords another means
of developing moral solidarity and of limiting purely selfish action;
but the maintenance of private property and individual initiative
seemed indispensable to the growth of production—a consideration
which renders it inimical to collectivism. Its moral character
explains the contrast between the precise nature of some of its
positive demands and the somewhat vague character of its general
principles, which may be applied to a greater or lesser extent according
to individual preferences. It is impossible to deny the essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
subjective character of its criteria, and this affords some indication
of the vigorous criticism offered by the economists, who are above
all anxious for scientific exactitude, and the measure of enthusiasm
with which it has been welcomed by all practical reformers. It
forms a kind of cross-roads where social Christianity, enlightened
conservatism, progressive democracy, and opportunistic socialism all
come together.</p>

<p>But its success was due not so much to the value of its principles
as to the peculiar nature of the political and economic evolution
toward the end of the century. Its most conspicuous representative
in Germany was Prince Bismarck, who was totally indifferent
to any theory of State Socialism, and who preferred to justify
his policy by an appeal to the principles of Christianity or the
Prussian Landrecht.<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> One of his great ambitions was to consolidate
and cement the national unity which he had succeeded
in creating. A system of national insurance financed and controlled
by the State appealed to him as the best way of weaning the working
classes from revolutionary socialism by giving them some positive
proof of the sympathy of the Government in the shape of pecuniary
interest in the welfare of the empire. In a somewhat similar fashion
the French peasant became attached to the Revolution through the
sale of national property. “I consider,” says Bismarck, speaking
of invalidity insurance, “that it is a tremendous gain for us to
have 700,000 annuitants among the very people who think they
have nothing to lose, but who sometimes wrongly imagine that
they might gain something by a change. These individuals would
lose anything from 115 to 200 marks, which just keeps them above
water. It is not much, perhaps, but it answers the purpose admirably.”<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>
Such was the origin of those important laws dealing
with sickness, accidents, invalidity, and old age which received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
the imperial seal between 1881 and 1889. But just because the
Chancellor did not consider that there was the same pecuniary
advantage to be derived from labour laws in the narrow sense of
the term—that is, in laws regulating the duration of labour, Sunday
rest, the inspection of factories, etc.—he was less favourably inclined
towards their extension. The personal predilection of the Emperor
William II, as expressed in the famous decrees of February 4, 1890,
was needed to give the Empire a new impetus in this direction.</p>

<p>Accordingly it was the intelligent conservatism of a Government
almost absolute in its power, but possessed of no definitely social
creed, that set about realising a part of the programme of the State
Socialists. In England and France and the other countries where
political liberty is an established fact similar measures have been
carried out at the express wish of an awakening democracy. The
working classes are beginning to find out how to utilise for their
own profit the larger share of government which they have recently
secured. Progressive taxation, insurance, protective measures for
workmen, more frequent intervention of Government with a view
to determining the conditions of labour, are just the expressions
of a tendency that operates independently of any preconceived plan.</p>

<p>The regulation of the relationship between masters and workmen
gave to State Socialism a legislative bias. Governments and
municipalities have long since extended their intervention to the
domain of production, the new character of social life rather than
any social theory being again the determining motive. Public
works, such as canals, roads, and railways, have multiplied enormously
in the course of the nineteenth century, thanks to the
existence of new productive forces. The demand for public services
has increased because of the increasing concentration of population.
Communal life keeps encroaching upon what was formerly an
isolated, dispersive existence, and community of interest is extending
its sway in village and borough as well as in the great city and the
nation at large. Industry also is being gradually linked together, and
the area of free competition is perforce becoming narrower. In the
labour market, as well as in the produce and the money markets,
concentration has taken the place of dispersion. Monopoly is
everywhere. Collective enterprise, instead of being the exception,
tends to be the rule, and public opinion is gradually being reconciled
to the idea of seeing the State—the “collective being” <i>par excellence</i>—becoming
in its turn industrial.</p>

<p>Under conditions such as these it was impossible that the
doctrine of State Socialism should not influence public opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>State Socialism has the peculiar merit of being able to translate
the confused aspirations of a new epoch in the history of politics and
economics into practical maxims without arousing the suspicions
of the public to the extent that socialism generally does. Legislators
and public men generally have been supplied with the necessary
arguments with which to defend the inauguration of that new policy
upon which they had secretly set their hearts. A common ground
of action is found for parties that are generally opposed to one
another and for temperaments that are usually incompatible. That
is the outstanding merit of a doctrine that seems eminently suitable
for the attainment of tangible results.</p>

<p>And so by a curious inversion of functions by no means exceptional
in the history of thought, State Socialism at the end of the
century finds itself playing the part of its great adversary, the
Liberal Optimism of the early century. One of the outstanding
merits of that earlier Liberalism was the preparation it afforded for
a policy of enfranchisement or liberty, which was absolutely necessary
for the development of the industrial <i>régime</i>. And so it became the
interpreter of the great economic currents of the time. In pursuance
of this exclusive task all traces of its scientific origin disappeared,
the elaboration of economic theory was neglected, and the habit of
close reasoning so essential to systematic thinking was abandoned.
In a somewhat similar manner State Socialism has become
the creed of all those who desire to put an end to the abuses
of economic liberty in its extremer aspects, or such as are generally
concerned about the miserable condition of an increasing number
of the working classes. Absorbed in immediate matters of this
kind, the promoters of State Socialism have managed to influence
practical politics without shedding much light upon economic
theory. And now they in their turn find their system threatened
by the fate which awaits all political doctrines. Even at the present
moment one is tempted to ask whether this growing multiplicity of
State function is not in danger of arousing on the part of consumers,
<i>entrepreneurs</i>, and workmen a general feeling of contempt for the
economic capacity of the State.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we must note another characteristic fact. Whereas
during the greater part of the nineteenth century the attacks of
Socialism were directed against Liberalism and economic orthodoxy,
Neo-Marxian syndicalism is concentrating its attention almost
exclusively upon State Socialism. Sorel emphasises the similarity
that exists between Marxism and Manchesterism, and on more
then one point he finds himself in agreement with a “Liberal”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
like Pareto. On the other hand, no words are sufficiently vigorous
to express his condemnation of the partisans of social peace and
interventionism, which appear to him to corrupt the working classes.
Syndicalist working men have on more than one occasion shown
their contempt for the State by refusing to avail themselves of
measures passed on their behalf—old-age pensions, for example.
This attitude is perhaps due to the influence of the anarchists upon
the leaders of French syndicalism.</p>

<p>The fusion of these two currents of ideas—the Neo-Marxian and
the anarchist—and their effect in turning the attention of the French
working classes away from State Socialism, is an interesting fact
whose political results will by no means prove negligible.<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading58">I: KARL MARX<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></h4>

<p>Everyone knows of the spell cast over the socialism of the last
forty years by the doctrines of Karl Marx and the contempt with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
which this newer so-called scientific socialism refers to the earlier or
Utopian kind. But what is even more striking than the success of
Marxian socialism is its want of sympathy with the heretical
doctrines of its predecessors the Communists and Fourierists, and
the pride it takes in regarding itself as a mere development or
rehabilitation of the great Classical tradition.</p>

<p>To give within the limits of a single chapter a <i>résumé</i> of a doctrine
that claims to review and to reconstruct the whole of economic
theory is clearly impossible, and we shall merely attempt an examination
of two of Marx’s more essential doctrines, namely, his
theory of surplus labour and value and his law of automatic appropriation,
more familiarly but less accurately known as the law of
concentration of capital. The first is based upon a particular conception
of exchange value and the second upon a special theory
of economic evolution. To employ Comtean phraseology, the one
belongs to the realm of economic statics, the other to the domain
of economic dynamics.</p>

<h5 id="heading59">1. <span class="smcap">Surplus Labour and Surplus Value</span></h5>

<p>The laborious demonstration which follows will become clearer if
we remind ourselves of the objects Marx had in view. Marx’s aim was
to show how the propertied class had always lived upon the labour of
the non-propertied classes—the possessors upon the non-possessing.
This was by no means a new idea, as we have already made its
acquaintance in the writings of Sismondi, Saint-Simon, Proudhon,
and Rodbertus. But the essence of the criticism of these writers
was always social rather than economic, the institution of private
property and its injustice being the chief object of attack. Karl
Marx, on the other hand, deliberately directed the gravamen of
the charge against economic science itself, especially against the
conception of exchange. He endeavours to prove that what we
call exploitation must always exist, that it is an inevitable outcome
of exchange—an economic necessity to which both master and man
must submit.</p>

<p>It is convenient to begin with an examination of economic value.
Marx lays down the doctrine that labour is not merely the measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
and cause of value, but that it is also its substance. We have
already had occasion to note how Ricardo was somewhat favourably
inclined to the same view, though hardly willing to adopt it. There
is no such hesitation on the part of Marx: it is all accepted in a
characteristically thorough fashion. Of course, he does not deny
that utility is a necessary condition of value and that it is really the
only consideration in the case of “value in use.” But utility alone
is not enough to explain value in exchange, since every act of
exchange implies some common element, some degree of identity
between the exchanged commodities. This identity is certainly not
the result of utility, because the degree of utility is different in every
commodity, and it is this difference that constitutes the <i>raison d’être</i>
of exchange. The common or homogeneous element which is
contained in commodities themselves heterogeneous in character
is the quantity of labour, great or small, which is contained in them.
The value of every commodity is simply the amount of crystallized
human labour which it contains, and commodities differ in value
according to the different quantities of labour which are “socially
necessary to produce them.”<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></p>

<p>Let us take the case of a working man, an employee in any
kind of industry, working ten hours a day.</p>

<p>What will be the exchange value of the produce of his labour?
It will be the equivalent of ten hours’ labour, whether the commodity
produced be cloth or coal or what not. And since the
master or the capitalist, as Marx always calls him, in accordance
with the terms of the wage bargain, reserves for himself the right of
disposing of that commodity, he sells it at its real value, which is
the equivalent of ten hours’ labour.</p>

<p>The worker himself is cut off with a wage which simply represents
the price which the capitalist pays for his labour force (<i>Arbeitskraft</i>),
and the capitalist reserves to himself the right of disposing
of the commodity at his own good pleasure. Its value is determined
in the same way as that of every other exchangeable commodity.
Labour-force or manual labour is just a commodity, and its value
is determined by the number of hours of labour necessary for its
production.<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<p>“The quantity of labour necessary to produce the labour-force”
is a somewhat formidable expression, and it is very difficult for any
one who is beginning a study of Marx to appreciate its significance,
but it is very essential that we should try, since everything turns
upon a clear understanding of this phrase. But it is really not so
mysterious after all. Suppose that instead of the labour of an
artisan we take the work of a machine. No engineer would be
surprised if we asked him the running expenses of that machine,
and he might reply that it was costing one or two tons of coal per
hour or eight or twelve <i>per diem</i>; and since the value of the coal
merely represents a certain amount of human labour on the part
of the coal-miner, there would be no difficulty in expressing it in
terms of labour. Under the wage system the labourer is simply a
machine, differing from the latter merely in the smaller quantity
of wealth which he produces. The value of an hour’s labour or a
day’s toil can be measured by the quantity of necessaries required
to keep the worker in full productive efficiency during that period.
Every employer who pays wages in kind—which is still the case in
agriculture—always makes that kind of calculation, and even when
the worker is paid a money wage things are much the same, for
the money simply represents the cost of those necessaries.</p>

<p>Let us proceed a step farther. The value of the commodities
necessary for the upkeep of labour is never equal to the value of
the produce of that labour. In the instance given it would not equal
the value of ten hours’ labour—perhaps not even five. Human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
labour under normal conditions always produces more than the
mere value of the goods consumed.<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a></p>

<p>This is the crux of the problem. The mystery surrounding
capitalist production is at last solved. The value produced by the
labourer passes into the hands of the capitalist, who disposes of it
and gives back to the labourer enough to pay for the food consumed
by him during the time he was producing the commodity.
The difference goes into the capitalist’s pocket. The product is
sold as the equivalent of ten hours’ labour, but the labourer
receives the equivalent of five hours only. Marx speaks of this as
surplus value (<i>Mehrwerth</i>), a term that has become exceedingly
popular since.<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

<p>Thus the capitalist gets ten hours’ labour out of the workman
and only pays him for five,<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> the other five hours costing
him nothing at all. During the first five hours the workman produces
the equivalent of his wages, but after the end of the fifth hour he
is working for nothing. The labour of this extra number of hours
during which the surplus value is being produced and for which the
worker receives nothing Marx calls surplus labour. By that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
means the supererogatory labour which yields nothing to the worker,
but merely involves an extra tax upon his energies and simply
increases the capitalist’s fortune.</p>

<p>Naturally the capitalist’s interest is to augment this surplus value
which goes to swell his profits. This can be effected in a number of
ways, and an analysis of some of these processes is one of the most
characteristic features of the Marxian doctrine. This analysis may
be summed up under two main divisions.</p>

<p>1. The first method is to prolong the working day as much
as possible in order to increase the number of hours of surplus
labour. If the number of working hours can be increased from
ten to twelve the surplus will automatically grow from five to seven.
This is exactly what manufacturers have always tried to do. Factory
legislation, however, has forced some of them to limit the number
of hours, and this has resulted in checking the growth of surplus
value somewhat. But this check applies only to a limited number
of industries.</p>

<p>2. A second method is to diminish the number of hours necessary
to produce the worker’s sustenance. Were this to fall from five to
three it is clear that the surplus would again rise from five to seven.
Such reduction is possible through the perfection of industrial
organisation or through a reduction in the cost of living, a result
which is usually effected by means of co-operation.<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> The capitalist
also often manages to bring this about by setting up philanthropic
institutions or by employing women and children, who require less
for their upkeep than adults. Women and children have been taken
from the house and the task of housekeeping and cookery has
been left in the hands of the men. But laws regulating the employment
of women and children have again defeated these tactics.<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is a very brief summary of Marx’s demonstration. Its
real originality lies in the fact that it does not consist of commonplace
recriminations concerning the exploitation of workers and the greed
of exploiters, but shows how the worker is robbed even when he
gets all that he is entitled to.<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> It cannot be said that the capitalist
has robbed him. He has paid him a fair price for his labour;
that is, he has given it its full exchange value. The conditions of
the wage bargain have been observed in every particular: equal
value has been given in exchange for equal value. Given the
capitalistic <i>régime</i> and the free competition of labour, the result
could not be otherwise. The worker, perhaps, may be surprised
at this unexpected result, which only secures him half the value
of his labour, but he can only look on like a bewildered spectator.
Everything has passed off quite correctly. The capitalist, no doubt,
is a shrewd person, and knows that when he buys labour power he
has got hold of a good thing, because it is the only merchandise which
possesses the mysterious capacity of producing more value than it
itself contains.<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> He knows this beforehand, and, as Marx says,
it is “the source of considerable pleasure to him.” “It is a particularly
happy condition of things when the buyer is also allowed
to sell it wherever and whenever he likes without having to part
with any of his privileges as a vendor.” The result is that the worker
has no means of defence either legal or economic, and is as helpless
as a peasant who has sold a cow in calf without knowing it.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have spoken only of labour. But the outstanding
personage in the book—the hero of the volume—is capital, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
name appears on the title-page. Our exposition of the Marxian
doctrine of production would accordingly be very incomplete if we
omitted to make reference to his treatment of capital.</p>

<p>Taken by itself capital is, of course, sterile, for it is understood
that labour is the sole source of value. But labour cannot produce
unless it consumes a certain proportion of capital, and it is important
that we should understand something of the combination of capital
and labour.</p>

<p>Marx distinguishes between two kinds of capital. The first
serves for the upkeep of the working-class population, either in
the way of wages or direct subsistence. The older economists
referred to it as the Wages Fund, and Marx calls it “variable capital.”
If this kind of capital does not directly take part in production, it is
this fund, after all, when consumed by labour that begets value and
the surplus which is attached to it.</p>

<p>That other kind of capital which directly assists the productive
activity of labour by supplying it with machinery, tools, etc.,
Marx calls “constant capital.” This latter kind of capital, which
is not absorbed or vitalized by labour, does not result in the
production of surplus value. It simply produces the equivalent of
its value, which is the sum total of all the values absorbed during
the time when it was being produced. This constant capital is
evidently the crystallized product of labour, and its value, like that
of any other product, is determined solely by the number of hours
of labour it has taken to produce. This value, whether it include
the cost of producing the raw material or merely the cost of labour
employed in elaborating it, should be rediscoverable in the finished
product. But there is nothing more—no surplus. The economists
refer to this as depreciation, and everyone knows that depreciation
implies no profits at any rate.<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a></p>

<p>It seems quite obvious that it is to the interest of the capitalist
to employ only variable capital, or at least that it will pay him
to reduce the amount of constant capital used to the irreducible
minimum.<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> But we are here met with an anomaly which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
despair of all Marxian commentators, and which must have caused
Marx himself some amount of embarrassment, if we may judge
by the laborious demonstration which he gives.<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p>If fixed capital is really unproductive, how is it that modern
production is always increasing the quantity of fixed capital which it
employs, until this has now become one of its most familiar features?
Is it because it yields less profit than that yielded by the smaller
handicrafts or agriculture? Again, how are we to account for the
variation in the rates of profit in different industries according to
the different quantities of capital employed, seeing that it is an
axiom of political economy that under a <i>régime</i> of free competition
with equal security for everybody the returns on different capitals
should everywhere be the same?</p>

<p>Marx replies by saying that the rate of profit is the same for all
capitalists within the country, but that this rate is the average
of the different rates in all the different industries. In other words,
it is the rate that would obtain if every industry in the country
employing varying amounts of fixed and circulating capital formed
a part of one whole. It must not be thought of as a kind of statistical
average, but simply as a kind of average which competition brings
about. The result is other than might have been expected.<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
industries which have a large amount of variable capital—agriculture,
for example—find themselves with just the average rate of return,
but draw much less in the way of surplus value than they had
expected, and so Marx refers to them as undertakings of an inferior
character. On the contrary, those industries which possess a large
amount of constant capital draw more than their capital had
led them to hope for, and Marx refers to them as industries of a
superior character.<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> Hence those industries which employ a considerable
amount of machinery expand at the expense of the others.
It is because the latter kind find themselves in a more favourable
position, or, in other words, realize greater profits, that they do
employ surplus labour, from which surplus value is naturally
derived.<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a></p>

<p>While admiring the ingenuity of the dialectics, we must not
blind ourselves to the simple fact which Marx was so anxious to hide,
but which is nevertheless implicit in all this, namely, that the rate
of profit, which means also the value of the goods, is regulated by
competition—that is, by demand and supply—but bears no relation
to the quantity of labour employed. We must also remember that
the <i>entrepreneur</i>, far from seeing his profits diminish as he employs
less human labour, finds them increasing. This contradiction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
just one of those flaws that finally cause the downfall of the majestic
edifice so laboriously raised by Marx.</p>

<h5 id="heading60">2. <span class="smcap">The Law of Concentration or Appropriation</span></h5>

<p>The law of concentration of capital,<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> which can only be interpreted
in the light of economic history, is an attempt to show that the
<i>régime</i> of private property and personal gain under which we live
is about to give place to an era of social enterprise and collective
property.<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> Let us try to follow the argument as given by
Marx.</p>

<p>Again must we cast back our thoughts to a period before the
earliest beginnings of capital in the sixteenth century—a period
when, according to the socialists, there existed neither capital nor
capitalist. Capital in the economic sense of a mere instrument of
production must have existed even before this time, but the socialists
are of opinion that it had quite a different significance then, and
it is important that we should appreciate their point of view. Their
employment of the term is closely akin to the vulgar use of the word
as anything that yields a rent, and yields the said rent as the result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
not of the capitalist’s labour, but of the toil of others. But under
the guild system which preceded this condition of things the majority
of the workers possessed most of the instruments of production
themselves.</p>

<p>Then follows a description of a series of changes which we cannot
attempt to study in detail, but which forms a singularly dramatic
chapter in the writings of Marx. New means of communication
are established and new markets opened as the result of important
mechanical discoveries coupled with the consolidation of the great
modern States. The rise of banks and of trading companies, together
with the formation of public debts, all this resulted in the concentration
of capital in the hands of a few and the expropriation of the
small proprietor.</p>

<p>But all this was only a beginning. If capital in this newer sense
of an instrument for making profit out of the labour of others was
ever to come into its own and develop, if the surplus labour and
surplus value of which we have given an analysis were really to
contribute to the growth and upkeep of this capital, it was necessary
that the capitalist should be able to buy that unique merchandise
which possesses such wonderful qualities in the open market. But
labour-force can never be bought unless it has been previously
detached from the instruments of production and removed from its
surroundings. Every connexion with property must be severed,
every trace of feudalism and of the guild system must be removed.
Labour must be free—that is, saleable; or, in other words, it “must
be forced to sell itself because the labourer has nothing else to sell.”
For a long time the artisan was in the habit of selling his goods
to the public without the intervention of any intermediary, but
a day dawned when, no longer able to sell his products, he was
reduced to selling himself.<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>The creation of this new kind of property based upon the labour
of others meant the extinction of that earlier form of property
founded upon personal labour and the substitution for it of the
modern proletariat. This was the task to which the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
resolutely set itself for about three centuries, and its proclamation
of the liberty of the labourer and the rights of man is just its
pæan of victory. Its task was accomplished. The expropriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
artisan who was already swelling the ranks of the proletariat seemed
an established fact.</p>

<p>In reality this end was only partially accomplished even in the
more capitalistic countries, but that there is a general movement in
that direction seems clear in view of the following considerations.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The most suggestive fact in this connexion is the growth of
production on a large scale, resulting in the employment of machinery
and in the rise of new forms of organisation such as trusts and
cartels, new systems that were unknown in Marx’s day, but which
have helped to confirm his suspicions. These trusts and cartels
are especially important from a social point of view because they
not only absorb the capital of the small independent proprietor, but
swallow the medium-sized industry as well. This wonderful expansion
of production on a large scale means a corresponding growth in
the numbers of the proletariat, and capitalism, by increasing the
number of wage-earners, helps to swell the ranks of its own enemies.
“What the <i>bourgeoisie</i> produces, above all, therefore, are its own
gravediggers.”<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Over-production is another fruitful method. A contraction
of the market results in a superabundance of workmen whose services
are always available. They form a kind of industrial reserve army
upon which the capitalist may draw at his pleasure—at one moment
indiscriminately taking on a number of them, and throwing them
back on to the streets again as soon as the demand shows signs of
slackening.<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The concentration of the rural population in towns is another
contributing factor. This movement itself is the result of the
disappearance of the small holder and the substitution of pastoral
for arable farming, the outcome of it all being an addition to the
ranks of the expropriated proletariat of an increasing number of
hitherto independent proprietors and producers.</p>

<p>Such is the advent and growth of capitalism. It comes into the
world “with bloody putrescence oozing out of every pore.” How
different is the real history of capital from the idyllic presentation to
which we are treated by the economists! They love to picture it
as the slowly accumulated fruit of labour and abstinence, and the
coexistence of the two classes, the capitalists and the workers,
is supposed to date from an adventure that befell them both a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
days after creation, when the good and the wise decided to follow
the high road of capitalism and the idle and vicious the stony path
of toil.</p>

<p>In reality capitalism is the outcome of class struggle—a struggle
that will some day spell the ruin of the whole <i>régime</i>, when the
expropriators will themselves be the expropriated. We are given
no details as to how this is to be accomplished, and this abstention
from prophecy distinguishes Marx from the Utopian socialists of the
last two thousand years. His one object was to show how those
very laws that led to the establishment of the <i>régime</i> would some
day encompass its ruin.<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> The force of circumstance seemed to
make self-destruction inevitable. “The capital <i>régime</i>,” writes
one Marxian socialist, “begets its own negation, and the process
is marked by that inevitability which is such a feature of all natural
laws.”<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> The following facts are deduced as proofs that this process
of self-destruction is already in course of being accomplished.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Industrial crises, whether of over-production or under-consumption,
have already become a chronic evil. The fact that
to some extent they are to be regarded as the direct outcome of the
capitalist system of production cannot prevent their damaging that
system. The continual growth of fixed at the expense of circulating
capital, involving as it does the substitution of machinery for
hand labour, must also involve a continual reduction of the surplus
value. In order to counteract this tendency the capitalists find
themselves forced to keep ahead with production; they are driven
to rely upon quantity, as they put it. The workers, on the other
hand, find that it is gradually becoming impossible for them to buy
the products of their labour with the wages which they get, because
they never get a wage which is equal to the value of the product of
their labour. Moreover, they periodically find themselves out of
employment altogether and almost on the verge of starvation.
Proudhon, as we have already seen, laid considerable stress upon
this, and it is one of the instances in which Marx is obviously
influenced by Proudhon.</p>

<p>The idea which underlies the Marxian theory is that every crisis
involves a readjustment of the equilibrium between fixed and circulating
capital. The growth of the former, though continuous, is
not always uniform, and whole sections of it may occasionally
be found to be without solid foundation which would warrant such
expansion. But the crises which result in the destruction of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
speculative accretions give a new spirit to the creation of further
surplus value, which results in the creation of further fixed capital
and more crises, and so the process goes on.<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The growth of pauperism, which is the direct outcome of
crises and want, is another factor. “The <i>bourgeoisie</i> is unfit any
longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions
of existence upon society as an overriding law. It is unfit to rule
because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within
his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state
that it has to feed him instead of being fed by him.”<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The rapid multiplication of joint stock companies is the
final buttress with which the Marxians have strengthened their
contention. Under the joint stock principle the right of property
is simply reduced to the possession of a few strips of paper giving
the anonymous owner the right to draw dividends in some commercial
concern or other. Profit is seen in all its nakedness as a dividend
which is wholly independent of all personal effort and produced
entirely as the result of the workers’ drudgery. The duty of personally
supervising the methods of production and of opening up
new and better ways of manufacturing, which served to disguise
the real character of the individual employer and to justify his
existence, is no longer performed by the owner, but falls to the lot
of two new functionaries, the parasitic company director on the
one hand and the salaried official on the other.</p>

<p>Once the whole industry of a country becomes organized on a
joint stock basis—or, better still, once it passes over into the
hands of a trust, which is simply a manifestation of the joint-stock
principle at its highest—expropriation will be a comparatively
simple matter. By a mere stroke of the pen property hitherto
held by private shareholders will be transferred into the custody
of the State with hardly a change in the economic mechanism itself.</p>

<p>Thus the expropriation of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> will be a much easier
task than was the expropriation of the artisan by the <i>bourgeois</i> a
few centuries ago. In the past it was a case of the few subjugating
the many, but in the future the many will overwhelm the few—thanks
to the law of concentration.</p>

<p>But what is to be the outcome of the Marxian programme (we
cannot speak of its aim or ideals, for Marx scorned such terms)?
The general opinion seems to be that it involves the abolition of
private property, and that the opinion is not altogether without
foundation may be seen from a perusal of the <i>Manifesto</i>, where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
read that “the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the
single sentence: Abolition of private property.”<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Manifesto</i> also explains in what sense we are to understand
this. The private property which so much needs suppressing is
not the right of the worker to the produce of his own toil, but the
right of others to appropriate for themselves the produce of that
labour. This is private property as they understand it. They
think, however, it would be better to call it <i>bourgeois</i> property, and
they feel quite confident that it is destined to disappear under a
collectivistic <i>régime</i>. As to a man’s right to the product of his
own labour, that surely existed formerly, before the peasant and the
craftsman were overwhelmed by capitalism and replaced by the
proletariat. Collectivism, far from destroying this kind of property,
will rather revive it, not in the antiquated individualistic form of
letting each man retain his own, which is obviously impossible
under division of labour and production on a large scale, but of
giving to every man a claim upon the equivalent of what he has
produced.<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p>This twofold task can only be accomplished by undoing all that
capitalism has done; by taking from the capitalists the instruments
of production which they now possess and restoring them to the
workmen, not individually—that would be impossible under modern
conditions—but collectively. To adopt the formula which figures
at the head of the party’s programme, this means the socialisation
of the means of production—land, including surface and subsoil,
factories and capital. The produce of everyone’s labour, after
allowing for certain expenses which must be borne by the community
as a whole, will be distributed according to each one’s
labour. Surplus labour and surplus value will thus disappear
simultaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>This expropriation of the capitalists will be the final stage, for,
unlike the preceding movements, it will not be undertaken for the
benefit of a single class—not even for the benefit of the workers.
It will be for the interest of everybody alike, for the benefit of the
nation as a whole. It will also be adequate to cope with the change
which industry has recently undergone; in other words, both
production and distribution will be on a collective basis.</p>

<h4 id="heading61">II: THE MARXIAN SCHOOL</h4>

<p>After this summary exposition of the principal theories of Karl
Marx, we must now try to fix the general character of the school
that bears his name<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> and to distinguish it from the other socialist
schools that we have already studied.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the first place, it proudly claims for its teaching the title
of <i>scientific</i> socialism, but much care must be exercised in interpreting
the formula. No economist has ever shown such contempt or
betrayed such passion in denouncing Phalanstères, Utopias, and
communistic schemes of every kind. To think that the Marxians
should add to the number of such fantastic dreams! What they
claim to do, as M. Labriola points out (may the shades of Fourier
forgive their presumption!), is to give a thoroughly scientific
demonstration of the line of progress which has actually been followed
by civilised societies.<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> Their one ambition is to gauge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
significance of the unconscious evolution through which society has
progressed and to point the goal towards which this cosmic process
seems to be tending.</p>

<p>The result is that the Marxian school has a conception of natural
laws which is much nearer the Classical standpoint than that of its
predecessors. Of this there can be no doubt. The Marxian theories
are derived directly from the theories of the leading economists of
the early nineteenth century, especially from Ricardo’s. Marx is in
the line of direct succession. Not only is this true of the labour-value
theory and of his treatment of the conflict between profits and
wages, but it also applies to his theory of rent and to a whole host
of Ricardian doctrines that have been absorbed wholesale into the
Marxian philosophy. And, paradoxical as it may sound, his abstract
dogmatic method, his obscure style, which encourages disciples
to retort that the critics have misunderstood his meaning and to
give to many a passage quite an esoteric significance, is of the very
essence of Ricardo.<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Marx’s theories are, of course, supported by
a wealth of illuminating facts, which unfortunately have been
unduly simplified and drawn upon for purely imaginary conclusions.
We have already had occasion to remark that Ricardo also owes
a good deal more to the observation of facts than is generally
believed, and his practice of postulating imaginary conditions is
of course notorious. The impenitent Marxian who still wishes
to defend some of the more untenable theories of Marx, such as
his doctrine of labour-value, generally finds himself forced to admit
that Marx had supposed (the use of suppositions is an unfailing
proof of Ricardian influence) the existence of society wherein labour
would be always uniform in quality.<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>Marxism is simply a branch grafted on the Classical trunk.
Astonished and indignant as the latter may well seem at the sight
of the strange fruit which its teaching has borne, it cannot deny
the fact that it has nourished it with its own life-blood. “<i>Das
Kapital</i>,” as Labriola notes, “instead of being the prologue to
the communal critique, is simply the epilogue of <i>bourgeois</i> economics.”<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p>Not only has Marxism always shown unfailing respect for political
economy even when attacking individual economists, who are
generally accused of inability to grasp the full significance of their
own teaching, but, strangely enough, it betrays an equal affection
for capitalism.<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> It has the greatest respect for the task which it
has already accomplished, and feels infinitely grateful for the revolutionary
part (such are the words used) which it has played in
preparing the way for collectivism, which is almost imperceptibly
usurping its place.<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a></p>

<p>But the Marxians have one serious quarrel with the older economists.
It seemed to them that the earliest writers on political
economy never realized the relatively transient nature of the social
organism which they were studying. This was possibly because
they were conservative by instinct and had the interest of the
<i>bourgeois</i> at heart. They always taught, and they fully believed it,
that private property and proletarianism were permanent features
of the modern world, and that social organisation was for ever
destined to remain upon a middle-class foundation. They were at
least unwilling to recognize that this also, like the rest, was simply a
historical category, and, like them, also was destined to vanish.<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Marxian school also differs from every previous socialist
school in the comparative ease with which it has eschewed every
consideration of justice and fraternity, which always played such
an important <i>rôle</i> in French socialism. It is interested, not in the
ideal, but in the actual, not in what ought to be, but in what is likely
to be. “The theoretical conclusions of the communists are in no
way based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered
by this or that would-be universal reformer. They merely
express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing
class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very
eyes.”<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>To economic facts they attributed an importance altogether
transcending their influence in the economic sphere. Their belief
was that the several links which unify the many-sided activities of
society, whether in politics, literature, art, morality, or religion,
are ultimately referable to some economic fact or other. None of
them but is based upon a purely economic consideration. Most
important of all are the facts relating to production, especially to
the mechanical instruments of production and their operation. If
we take, for example, the production of bread and the successive
stages through which the mechanical operation of grinding has
passed from the hand-mill of antiquity to the water-mill of the Middle
Ages and the steam-mill of to-day, we have a clue to the parallel
development of society from the family to the capitalistic system
and from the capitalistic to the trust, with their concomitants
slavery, serfdom, and proletarianism. This affords a far better
explanation of the facts than any <i>bourgeois</i> cant about “the growth
of freedom” or humbug of that nature. These are the real foundations
upon which every theory has to be reared. This materialistic
conception of history,<a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> implying as it does a complete philosophy
of history, is no longer confined to the purely economic domain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>Taken in the vulgar sense, it seems to involve the exclusion of
every moral and every humanitarian consideration. As Schäffle
put it in that oft-quoted phrase of his, it means reducing the social
question to a “mere question of the belly.” The French socialists
find the doctrine somewhat difficult to swallow, and they hardly
display the same reverence for Marx as is shown in some other
countries.<a name="FNanchor_1001" id="FNanchor_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p>

<p>The orthodox Marxians immediately proceed to point out that
such criticism is useless and shows a complete misunderstanding of
Marx’s position. Materialism in the Marxian sense (and all his
terms have a Marxian as well as the ordinary significance) does not
exclude idealism, but it does exclude ideology, which is a different
thing. No Marxian has ever advocated leaving mankind at the
mercy of its economic environment; on the contrary, the Marxian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
builds his faith upon evolution, which implies man’s conscious, but
not very successful, effort to improve his economic surroundings.<a name="FNanchor_1002" id="FNanchor_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>
The materialistic conception of history apparently is simply an
attempt at a philosophy of human effort.<a name="FNanchor_1003" id="FNanchor_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> Criticism of such elusive
doctrines is not a very easy task.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The socialism of Karl Marx is exclusively a working-class
gospel. This is its distinctive trait and the source of the power it
wields. To some extent it also explains its persistence. Other
socialist systems have been discredited and are gone, but the Marxian
gospel—no longer, of course, the sublime masterpiece it was when
its author first expounded it—has lost none of its ancient vigour,
despite the many transformations which it has undergone.</p>

<p>The socialists of the first half of the nineteenth century embraced
all men without distinction, worker and <i>bourgeois</i> alike, within
their broad humanitarian schemes. Owen, Fourier, and Saint-Simon
reckoned upon the co-operation of the wealthy governing classes to
found the society of the future. Marxism implies a totally different
standpoint. There is to be no attempt at an understanding with
the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, there must be no dallying with the unclean thing,
and the prohibition is to apply not only to the capitalists, but also
to the intellectuals<a name="FNanchor_1004" id="FNanchor_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> and to the whole hierarchical superstructure
that usually goes by the name of officialdom. Real socialism aims
at nothing but the welfare of the working classes, which will only
become possible when they attain to power.</p>

<p>It may, of course, be pointed out that socialism has always
involved some such struggle between rich and poor, but it is equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
correct to say that the battle has hitherto been waged over the
question of just distribution. Beyond that there was no issue.
But in the Marxian doctrine the antagonism is dignified with the
name of a new scientific law, the “class war”—the worker against
the capitalist, the poor <i>versus</i> the rich. The individuals are the
same, but the <i>casus belli</i> is quite different. “Class war” is a
phrase that has contributed not a little to the success of Marxism,
and those who understand not a single word of the theory—and
this applies to the vast majority of working men—will never forget
the formula. It will always serve to keep the powder dry, at any
rate.</p>

<p>“Class war” was not a new fact. “The history of all hitherto
existing society is the history of class struggles.”<a name="FNanchor_1005" id="FNanchor_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> But although
it has always existed, it cannot continue for ever. And the great
struggle that is now drawing nigh and which gives us such a tragic
interest in the whole campaign will be the last. The collectivist
<i>régime</i> will destroy the conditions that breed antagonism, and so
will get rid of the classes themselves. Let us note in passing
that this prophecy is not without a strong tinge of that Utopian
optimism which the Marxians considered such a weakness in the
earlier French socialism.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A final distinction of Marxism is its purely revolutionary or
catastrophic character, which is again unmistakably indicated by its
adoption of “class war” as its watchword. But we have only to
remind ourselves that the adjective “revolutionary” is applied by
the Marxians to ordinary middle-class action to realize that the term
is employed in a somewhat unusual fashion.</p>

<p>The revolution will result in the subjection of the wealthier
classes by the working men, but all this will be accomplished, not
by having recourse to the guillotine or by resorting to street rioting,
but in a perfectly peaceful fashion. The means may be political
and the method even within the four corners of the law, for the
working classes may easily acquire a majority in Parliament, seeing
that they already form the majority of the electors, especially
in those countries that have adopted universal suffrage. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
method may be simply that of economic associations of working
men taking all economic services into their own hands.<a name="FNanchor_1006" id="FNanchor_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p>The final catastrophe may come in yet another guise, and most
Marxians seem to centre their hopes upon this last possibility. This
would take the form of an economic crisis resulting in the complete
overthrow of the whole capitalist <i>régime</i>—a kind of economic <i>felo
de se</i>. We have already noted the important place which crises
hold in the Marxian doctrines.</p>

<p>But if Marxism does not necessarily involve resort to violence,
violent methods are not excluded. Indeed, it considers that some
measure of struggle is inevitable before the old social forms can
be delivered of the new—before the butterfly can issue from the
chrysalis. “Force is the birth-pangs of society.”<a name="FNanchor_1007" id="FNanchor_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p>This is not the place for false sentimentalism. Evil and suffering
seem to be the indispensable agents of evolution. Had anyone been
able to suppress slavery or serfdom or to prevent the expropriation
of the worker by the capitalist, it would have merely meant drying
up the springs of progress and more evil than good would probably
have resulted.<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> Every step forward involves certain unpleasant
conditions, which must be faced if the higher forms of existence
are ever to become a reality. And for this reason the reform
of the <i>bourgeois</i> philanthropist and the preaching of social peace
would be found to be harmful if they ever proved at all successful.
There is no progress where there is no struggle. This disdainful
indifference to the unavoidable suffering involved in transition is
inherited from the Classical economists, and provides one more point
of resemblance between the two doctrines. Almost identical terms
were employed by the Classical economists when speaking of competition,
of machinery, or of the absorption of the small industry
by a greater one. In the opinion of the Marxians no attempt at
improving matters is worthy the name of reform unless it also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
speeds the coming revolution. “But it can shorten and lessen the
birth-pangs.”<a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading62">III: THE MARXIAN CRISIS AND THE NEO-MARXIANS</h4>

<p>To speak of Neo-Marxism, which is of quite recent growth, is to
anticipate the chronological order somewhat, but some such procedure
seems imperative in the interests of logical sequence. It has
the further merit of dispensing with any attempt at criticism, a
task which the Neo-Marxians<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> have exclusively taken upon their
own shoulders.</p>

<p>The two phases of the crisis must needs be kept distinct. The
one, which is predominantly critical—or reformative, if that phrase
be preferred—is best represented by M. Bernstein and his school.
The other, which is more or less of an attempt to revive Marxism,
has become current under the name of Syndicalism.</p>

<h5 id="heading63">1. <span class="smcap">The Neo-Marxian Reformists</span></h5>

<p>If we take Marx’s economic theories one by one as we have done,
we shall find that there is nothing very striking in any of them,
and that even the most important of them will not stand critical
scrutiny. We might even go farther and say that this work of
demolition is partly due to the posthumous labours of Marx himself.
It was the publication of his later volumes that served to call attention
to the serious contradiction between the later and the earlier
sections of his work. Marxism itself, it seems, fell a prey to that
law of self-destruction which threatened the overthrow of the whole
capitalistic <i>régime</i>. Some of Marx’s disciples have, of course, tried
to justify him by claiming that the work is not self-contradictory,
but that the mere enumeration of the many conflicting aspects of
capitalistic production strikes the mind as being contradictory.<a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> If
this be so, then <i>Kapital</i> is just a new edition of Proudhon’s <i>Contradictions
économiques</i>, which Marx had treated with such biting
ridicule. And if the capitalist <i>régime</i> is really so full of contradictions
that are inherent in its very nature, how difficult it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
to tell whether it will eventuate in collectivism or not and how
very rash is scientific prophecy about annihilation and a final
catastrophe!<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>The fundamental theory of Marxism, that of labour-value, appears
to be abandoned by the majority of modern Marxians, who are
gradually veering round and adopting either the “final utility” or
the “economic equilibrium” theory.<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> Even Marx himself, despite
his formal acceptance of the labour-value theory, is constantly
obliged to admit—not explicitly, of course—that value depends
upon demand and supply.<a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> Especially is this the case with profits,
as we have already had occasion to remark. What appears as an
indisputable axiom in the first volume is treated as a mere working
hypothesis in the later ones.</p>

<p>But seeing that the other Marxian doctrines—the theories of
surplus value and surplus labour, for example—are mere deductions
from the principle of labour-value, it follows that the overthrow of
the first principle must involve the ruin of the other two. If labour
does not necessarily create value, or if value can be created without
labour, then there is no proof that labour <i>always</i> begets a surplus value
and that the capitalist’s profit must largely consist of unremunerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
labour. The Neo-Marxians in reply point to the fact that surplus
labour and surplus value do exist, else how could some individuals
live without working? They must obviously be dependent upon
the labour of others.<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> All this is very true, but the fact had been
announced by Sismondi long before, and the evil had been denounced
both by him and the English critics. It is the old problem of
unearned increment which formed the basis of Saint-Simon’s
doctrine and Rodbertus’s theory, and which has been taken up quite
recently by the English Fabians.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see what definite contribution Marx has made to
the question, and the old problem as to whether workers are really
exploited or not and whether the revenues obtained by the so-called
idle classes correspond to any real additional value contributed by
themselves still remains unsettled. We can only say that his
historical exposition contains several very striking instances which
seem to prove this exploitation, and that this is really the most
solid part of his work.</p>

<p>Passing on to the law of concentration—the vertebral column
of the Marxian doctrine—we shall find upon examination that it is
in an equally piteous condition. The most unsparing critic in
this case has been a socialist of the name of Bernstein, who has
adduced a great number of facts<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a>—many of them already advanced
by the older economists—which go to disprove the Marxian theory.
It may be impossible to deny that the number of great industries is
increasing rapidly and that their power is growing even more rapidly
than their numbers, but it certainly does not seem as if the small
proprietors and manufacturers were being ousted. Statistics, on
the contrary, show that the number of small independent manufacturers
(the artisans who, according to Marxian theory, had begun
to disappear as far back as the fourteenth century) is actually
increasing. Some new invention, such as photography, cycling,
or the application of electricity to domestic work, or the revival of
an industry such as horticulture, gives rise to a crowd of small
industries and new manufactures.</p>

<p>But concentration as yet has scarcely made an appearance
even in agriculture, and all the efforts of the Marxians to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
this industry fit in with their theory have proved utterly useless.
America as well as Europe has been laid under tribute with a view
to supplying figures that would prove their contention. The
statistics, however, are so confusing that directly opposite conclusions
may be drawn from the same set of figures. The amount of
support which they lend to the Marxian contention seems very
slight indeed. On the whole they may be said to lend colour to
the opposite view that the number of businesses is at least keeping
pace with the growth of population. Were this to be definitely
verified it would set a twofold check upon the Marxian theory. Not
only would it be proved that <i>petite culture</i> is on the increase, but it
would also be found that it is on the increase simply because it is
more productive than “the great industry.”</p>

<p>But suppose for the sake of hypothesis that we accept the law
of concentration as proved. That in itself is not enough to justify
the Marxian doctrine. To do this statistics proving an increasing
concentration of property in the hands of fewer individuals are also
necessary; but in this case the testimony of the figures is all in the
opposite direction. We must not be deceived by the appearance
of that new species, the American millionaire. There are men who
are richer than the richest who ever lived before, but there are also
more men who are fairly rich than ever was the case before. The
number of men who make a fortune—not a very great one, perhaps,
but a moderate-sized or even a small one—is constantly growing.
Joint stock companies, which according to the Marxian view afforded
striking evidence of the correctness of his thesis, have, on the contrary,
resulted in the distribution of property between a greater
number of people, which proves that the concentration of industry
and the centralisation of property are two different things. Or
take the wonderful development of the co-operative movement and
reflect upon the number of proletarians who have been transformed
into small capitalists entirely through its instrumentality. To
think that expropriation in the future will be easier because the
number of expropriated will be few seems quite contrary to facts.
It looks as if it were the masses, whose numbers are daily increasing,
who will have to be expropriated, after all. More than half the
French people at the present day possess property of one kind or
another—movable property, land, or houses. And yet the collectivists
never speak except with the greatest contempt of these
rag-ends and tatters of property, fondly imagining that when the
day of expropriation comes the expropriated will joyfully throw
their rags aside in return for the blessings of social co-proprietorship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
Apparently, however, the Marxians themselves no longer believe all
this. Their language has changed completely, and just now they
are very anxious to keep these rags and tatters in the hands of their
rightful owners.</p>

<p>The changes introduced into the programme as a result of this
have transformed its character almost completely. When it was
first drawn up and issued as a part of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>
nearly fifty years ago everybody expected that the final disappearance
of the small proprietor was a matter of only a few years, and that
at the end of that time property of every description would be
concentrated in the hands of a powerful few. This continuous
expropriation would, of course, swell the ranks of the proletariat,
so that compared with their numbers the proprietors would be a
mere handful. This would make the final expropriation all the easier.
With such disparity in numbers the issue was a foregone conclusion,
no matter what method was employed, were it a revolution or merely
a parliamentary vote.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the execution of this programme, not only do
we find the great capitalist still waxing strong, which is quite in
accordance with the orthodox Marxian view, but there is no evidence
that the small proprietor or manufacturer is on the wane. The
Marxian can scarcely console himself with the thought that the
revolution is gradually being accomplished without opposition when
he sees hundreds of peasant proprietors, master craftsmen, and
small shopkeepers on every side of him. Nor is there much chance
of forcing this growing mass of people, which possibly includes the
majority of the community even now, to change its views. We can
hardly expect them to be very enthusiastic about a programme that
involves their own extinction.</p>

<p>A distinction has obviously been drawn between two classes of
proprietors. The socialisation of the means of production is only to
apply to the case of wealthy landowners and manufacturers on a
large scale—to those who employ salaried persons. But the property
of the man who is supporting himself with the labour of his own
hands will always be respected. The Marxians defend themselves
from the reproach of self-contradiction and opportunism by stating
that their action is strictly in accordance with the process of evolution.
You begin by expropriating those industries that have arrived
at the capitalistic and wage-earning stage. The criterion must be
the presence or otherwise of a surplus value.</p>

<p>The conclusion is logical enough, but one would like to know
what is going to become of the small independent proprietor. Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
he be allowed to grow and develop alongside of the one great proprietor—the
State? We can hardly imagine the two systems
coexisting and hopelessly intermingled, as they would have to be,
but still with freedom for the individual to choose between them.
The collectivists have at any rate made no attempt to disguise
the fact. They look upon it merely as a temporary concession to
the cowardice of the small proprietor, who will presently willingly
abandon his own miserable bit of property in order to share in the
benefits of the new <i>régime</i>, or who will at any rate be put out of
the running by its economic superiority. But since the prospects
do not seem very attractive to those immediately concerned, it
may be as well to dispense with any further consideration of the
subject.</p>

<p>But there is another question. What has become of the class
struggle in Neo-Marxism? The doctrine, though not altogether
denied, is no longer presented as a deadly duel between two classes
and only two, but as a kind of confused <i>mêlée</i> involving a great
number of classes, which makes the issue of the conflict very uncertain.
The picture of society as consisting merely of two superimposed
layers is dismissed as being altogether too elementary. On
the contrary, what we find is increasing differentiation even within
the capitalist class itself. There is a perpetual conflict going on
between borrower and lender, between manufacturer and merchant,
between trader and landlord, the last of which struggles is especially
prominent in the annals of politics. It has a long history, but in
modern times it takes the form of a political battle between the Conservative
and Liberal parties, between Whigs and Tories. These
undercurrents complicate matters a great deal, and on occasion they
have a way of dramatically merging with the main current, when
both parties seek the help of the proletariat. In England, for
example, the manufacturers succeeded in repealing the Corn Laws,
which dealt a hard blow at the landed proprietors, who in turn
passed laws regulating the conditions of labour in mines and factories.
In both cases the working classes gained something—<i>tertius gaudens</i>!
Then there are the struggles among the working classes themselves.
Not to speak of the bitter animosity between the <i>syndicats
rouges</i> and the <i>syndicats jaunes</i>, there is the rivalry between syndicalists
and non-syndicalists, between skilled workmen and the
unskilled. As Leroy-Beaulieu remarks, not only have we a fourth
estate, but there are already signs of a fifth.</p>

<p>And what of the great catastrophe? The Neo-Marxians no
longer believe in it. The economic crises which furnished the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
principal argument in support of the catastrophic theory are by no
means as terrible as they were when Marx wrote. They are no longer
regarded as of the nature of financial earthquakes, but much more
nearly resemble the movements of the sea, whose ebb and flow may
to some extent be calculated.</p>

<p>And the materialistic conception of history? “Every unbiased
person must subscribe to that formula of Bernstein: The influence
of technico-economic evolution upon the evolution of other social
institutions is becoming less and less.”<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> What a number of proofs
of this we have! Marxism itself furnishes us with some. The
principle of class war and the appeal to class prejudice owe much
of the hold which they have to a feeling of antagonism against
economic fatalism. In other words, they draw much of their
strength from an appeal to a certain ideal. It is, of course, true
that facts of very different character, economic, political, and moral,
react upon one another, but can anyone say that some one of them
determines all the others? Economists have been forced to recognise
this, and the futile attempt to discover cause or effect has
recently given place to a much more promising search for purely
reciprocal relations.</p>

<p>It is by no means easy to determine how much Marxism there
is in Neo-Marxism. “Is there anything beyond the formulæ which
we have quoted, and which are becoming more disputable every
day? Is it anything more than a philosophical theory which
purports to explain the conflicts of society?”<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> Bernstein tells us
somewhere that socialism is just a movement, and that “the movement
is everything, the end is nothing.”<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a></p>

<h5 id="heading64">2. <span class="smcap">The Neo-Marxian Syndicalists</span></h5>

<p>Doctrinaire Marxism seemed languishing when a number of
professed disciples found a fresh opportunity of reviving its ideals
and of justifying its aims in a new movement of a pre-eminently
working-class character known as Syndicalism.</p>

<p>Our concern is not with the reformist movement, occasionally
spoken of as Trade Unionism, which constitutes the special province
of M. Bernstein and the Neo-Marxians of his school,<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> but rather with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
militant syndicalism, which as yet scarcely exists anywhere except
in France and Italy, and which in France is represented by the
Confédération générale du Travail.</p>

<p>What connection is there between Marxism and syndicalism?
Of conscious, deliberate relationship there is scarcely any. The men
who direct the Confédération have never read Marx, possibly, and
would hardly concern themselves with the application of his doctrines.
On the other hand, we have recently been told that the programme
of the Confédération générale du Travail (C.G.T.) is in strict conformity
with the Marxian doctrine; that since the reforming passion
has so seized hold of the Neo-Marxians as to drive them to undermine
the older doctrine altogether, it is necessary to turn to the new school
to find the pure doctrine. They make the further claim of having
aroused new enthusiasm for the Marxian doctrines.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the first place they have re-emphasised the essentially
proletarian character of socialism. Not only is there to be no
dealing with capitalist or <i>entrepreneur</i>, but no quarter is to be given
to the intellectuals or the politicians. The professional labour
syndicate is to exclude everyone who is not a workman, and it
has no interest at heart other than that of the working class.<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>
Contempt for intellectualism is a feature of Marxism, and so is the
emphasis laid upon the beauty and worth of labour, not of every
kind of labour, but merely of that labour which moulds or transforms
matter—that is, of purely manual labour.</p>

<p>No institution seems better fitted to develop class feeling—that
is, the sense of community of interests binding all the proletarians
together against the owners—than the <i>syndicat</i>. Organisation
is necessary if social consciousness is to develop. This is as
true in the economic as it is in the biological sphere, and this is why
the <i>syndicat</i> is just what was needed to transform the old socialistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
conception into real socialism. Marx could not possibly have foreseen
the vast potentialities of the <i>syndicat</i>. If he had only known
it how his heart would have rejoiced! The Neo-Marxians can
never speak of syndicalism without going into raptures. No other
new source of energy seems left in this tottering middle-class system.
But syndicalism has within it the promise of a new society, of a new
philosophy, even of a new code of morality which we may call
producers’ ethics, which will have its roots in professional honour,
in the joy that comes from the accomplishment of some piece of
work, and in their faith in progress.<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) New stress has been laid upon the philosophy of class war,
and a fresh appeal has been made for putting it into practice. The
only real, sensible kind of revolution is that which must sooner or
later take place between capitalists on the one hand and wage-earners
on the other, and this kind of revolution can only be effected
by appealing to class feeling and by resorting to every instrument
of conflict, strikes, open violence, etc. All attempts at establishing
an understanding with the <i>bourgeois</i> class, every appeal for State
intervention or for concessions, must be abandoned. Explicit trust
must be placed in the method of direct action.<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>Strife is to be the keynote of the future, and in the pending
struggle every trace of <i>bourgeois</i> legalism will be ruthlessly swept
aside. The fighting spirit must be kept up, not with a view to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
intensification of class hatred, but simply in order to hand on
the torch.</p>

<p>The struggle has hitherto been the one concern of the revolutionary
syndicalists. Unlike the socialists, they have never paid any
attention either to labour or to social organisation. All this has,
fortunately, been done by the capitalist, and all that is required
now is simply to remove him.<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Nor has the catastrophic thesis been forgotten. This time
it has been revived, not in the form of a financial crisis, but in
the guise of a general strike. What will all the <i>bourgeois</i> generalship,
all the artillery of the middle class, avail in a struggle of
that kind? What is to be done when the worker just folds his
arms and instantly brings all social life to a standstill, thus proving
that labour is really the creator of all wealth? And although
one may be very sceptical as to the possibility of a general strike—the
scepticism is one that is fully shared in by the syndicalists
themselves—still this “myth,” as Sorel calls it, must give a very
powerful stimulus to action, just as the Christians of the early
centuries displayed wonderful activity in view of their expectation
of the second coming of Christ.</p>

<p>The word “myth” has been a great success, not so much among
working men, to whom it means nothing at all, but among the
intellectuals. It is very amusing to think that this exclusively
working-class socialism, which is not merely anti-capitalist, but also
violently anti-intellectual, and which is to “treat the advances of
the <i>bourgeoisie</i> with undisguised brutality,” is the work of a small
group of “intellectuals” possessed of remarkable subtlety, and
even claiming kinship with Bergsonian philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> A myth
perhaps! But what difference is there between being under the
dominion of a myth and following in the wake of a star such as
guided the wise men of the East, or being led by a pillar of flame
or a cloud such as went before the Israelites on their pilgrimage
towards the Promised Land?<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> Such faith and hope borrowed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
the armoury of the triumphant Church of the first century, such a
conception of progress which swells its followers with a generous,
almost heroic passion, puts us out of touch with the historic materialism
so dear to the heart of Marx and brings us into line with the
earlier Utopian socialists whom he so genuinely despised. Sorel
recognises this. “You rarely meet with a pure myth,” says he,
“without some admixture of Utopianism.”</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV_DOCTRINES_THAT_OWE_THEIR">CHAPTER IV: DOCTRINES THAT OWE THEIR
INSPIRATION TO CHRISTIANITY</h3>

<p>Everyone who knows the Bible at all or has the slightest acquaintance
with the writings of the early Fathers must have been struck
by the number of texts which they contain bearing upon social and
economic questions. And one has only to recall the imprecations
of the prophets as they contemplate the misdeeds of merchants and
the greed of land-grabbers, or strive to catch the spirit of the parables
of Jesus or the epistles of the Fathers concerning the duty of the rich
towards the poor—a point emphasised by Bossuet in his sermon
on <i>The Eminent Dignity of the Poor</i>—or dip into the folios of the
Canonists or the Summa of Aquinas, to realise how imperative were
the demands of religion and with what revolutionary vehemence its
claims were upheld.<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>But not until the middle of the nineteenth century do we meet
with social doctrines of a definitely Christian type, and not till
then do we witness the formation of schools of social thinkers who
place the teaching of the Gospel in the forefront of their programme,
hoping that it may supply them with a solution of current economic
problems and with a plan of social reconstruction.<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> It is not
difficult to account for their appearance at this juncture. Their
primary object was to bear witness to the heresy of socialism, and
the nature of the object became more and more evident as socialism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
tended to become more materialistic and anti-Christian. It became
the Church’s one desire to win back souls from the pursuit of this new
cult. It was the fear of seeing the people—her own people—enrol
themselves under the red flag of the Anti-Christ that roused her
ardour.<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> But to regard it as a mere question of worldly rivalry
would be childish and misleading. Rather must we see in it a
reawakening of Christian conscience and a searching of heart as
to whether the Church herself had not betrayed her Christ, and in
contemplation of her heavenly had not forgotten her earthly mission,
which was equally a part of her message; whether in repeating the
Lord’s Prayer for the coming of the Kingdom and the giving of daily
bread she had forgotten that the Kingdom was to be established
on earth and that the daily bread meant, not charity, but the wages
of labour.</p>

<p>Both doctrines and schools are of a most heterogeneous character,
ranging from authoritative conservatism to almost revolutionary
anarchism, and it will not be without some effort that we shall
include them all within the limits of a single chapter. But it is
not impossible to point to certain common characteristics, both
positive and negative, which entitle us to regard them all as members
of one family.</p>

<p>As a negative trait we have their unanimous repudiation of
Classical Liberalism. This does not necessarily imply a disposition
to invoke State aid, for some of them, as we shall see, are opposed
even to the idea of a State. Neither does it imply a denial of a
“natural order,” for under the name of Providence and as a
manifestation of the will of God the “order” was a source of
perennial delight to them. But man was to them an outcast without
lot or portion in the “order.” Fallen and sinful, bereft of his
freedom, it was impossible that of himself he should return to his
former state of bliss. To leave the natural man alone, to deliver
him over to the pursuit of personal interest in the hope that it
might lead him to the good or result in the rediscovery of the lost
way of Paradise, was clearly absurd. It was as futile in the economic
as it was in the religious sphere. On the contrary, the Christian
schools maintained that the “natural” man, the old man, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
first Adam of the New Testament, must somehow be got rid of
before room could be found for the new man within us. Every
available force, whether religious, moral, or merely social, must be
utilised to keep people from the dangerous slope down which egoism
would inevitably lead them.<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></p>

<p>The new doctrines are also distinct from socialism, despite the fact
that their followers frequently outbid the socialists in the bitterness of
their attacks upon capital and the present organisation of society.
They refuse to believe that the creation of a new society in the sense
of a change in economic conditions or environment is enough. The
individual must also be changed. To those who questioned Christ
as to when the Kingdom of God should come, He replied, “The
kingdom of God cometh not with observation … for, behold, the
kingdom of God is within you,” and His answer is witness to the
fact that social justice will only reign when it has achieved victory
over human hearts. Social Christianity must never be compared
with the socialism of the Liberals or the Associationists, for the latter
believed man to be naturally good apart from the deteriorating
effects of civilisation. Nor must it ever be classed with the collectivism
of Marx, which has its basis in a materialistic conception
of history and class war. Some of these Christian authors, it is
true, regard State Socialism with a certain degree of favour and
would possibly welcome co-operation, but to most of them legal
coercion does not seem very attractive and they prefer to put their
faith in associations such as the family, the corporation, or the
co-operative society. We could hardly expect otherwise, seeing
that every church is an organisation of some kind or other. The
Catholic Church especially, whatever opinion we may have of it, is
at once the greatest and the noblest association that ever existed.
Its bonds are even stronger than death. The Church militant
below joins hands with the Church triumphant above, the living
praying for the dead and the dead interceding for the living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>From a constructive standpoint they defy classification. They
have a common aspiration in their hope of a society where all men
will be brothers, children of the one Heavenly Father,<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> but many
are the ways of attaining this fraternal ideal. In the same spirit
they speak of a just price and a fair wage much as the Canonists
of the Middle Ages did. In other words, they refuse to regard
human labour as a mere commodity whose value varies according
to the laws of supply and demand. The labour of men is sacred,
and Roman law even refused to recognise bartering in <i>res sacræ</i>.
But when it becomes a question of formulating means of doing this,
the ways divide. Numerous as are the Biblical texts which bear upon
social and economic questions, they are extraordinarily vague. At least
they seem capable of affording support to the most divergent doctrines.</p>

<p>Some might consider it a mistake to devote a whole chapter to
these doctrines, seeing that they are moral rather than economic,
and that, with perhaps the exception of Le Play, who is only indirectly
connected with this school, we have no names that can be compared
with those already mentioned. But not a few intellectual movements
are of an anonymous character. The importance of a
doctrine ought not to be measured by the illustrious character of
its sponsor so much as by the effect which it has had upon
the minds of men. No one will be prepared to deny the influence
which these doctrines have exercised upon religious people, an
influence greater than either Fourier’s, Saint-Simon’s, or Proudhon’s.
Moreover, they are connected with the development of important
economic institutions, such as the attempt to revive the system of
corporations in Austria, the establishment of rural banks in Germany
and France, the development of co-operative societies in England,
the growth of temperance societies, the agitation for Sunday rest, etc.
Nor must we forget that the pioneers of factory legislation, the
founders of workmen’s institutes, men like Lord Shaftesbury in
England, Pastor Oberlin, and Daniel Legrand the manufacturer,
were really Christian Socialists.</p>

<h4 id="heading65">I: LE PLAY’S SCHOOL</h4>

<p>Le Play’s<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> school is very closely related to the Classical Liberal,
some of its best known representatives actually belonging to both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
There is the same antipathy to socialism and the same dread of
State intervention.</p>

<p>But it is not difficult to differentiate from the more extreme
Liberal school which finds its most optimistic expression in the
works of certain French writers. The cardinal doctrine of that
school, namely, that individual effort is alone sufficient for all things,
finds no place in Le Play’s philosophy. Man, it seemed to him,
was ignorant of what his own well-being involved. In the realm
of social science no fact seemed more persistent or more patent
than error. Every individual appeared to be born with a natural
tendency to evil, and he picturesquely remarks that “every new
generation is just an invasion of young barbarians that must be
educated and trained. Whenever such training is by any chance
neglected, decadence becomes imminent.”<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<p>Among the errors more particularly denounced by Le Play were
the special idols of the French <i>bourgeois</i>—the “false dogmas of
’89” as he calls them.<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> It seemed to him that no society could
ever hope to exist for any length of time and still be content with
the rule of natural laws, which merely meant being ruled by the
untamed instincts of the brute. It must set to and reform itself.
Hence his book is entitled <i>Social Reform</i>, and the school which
he founded adopted the same title.</p>

<p>Some kind of authority is clearly indispensable; the question
is what it should be. The old paterfamilias relation immediately
suggests itself as being more efficacious than any other, seeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
it is founded in nature and not on contract or decree, and springs
from love rather than coercion. The family group under the
authority of its chief, which was the sole social unit under the
patriarchal system, must again be revived in the midst of our
complex social relations. But parental control cannot always be
relied upon, for the parent is frequently engrossed with the other
demands of life, and there is positive need for some social authority.
This new social authority will not be the State—that is, if Le Play
can possibly avoid it. The first chance will be given to “natural”
authorities—those authorities which rise up spontaneously. The
nobility is well fitted for the task where it exists. In the absence of
nobility, or where, as was unfortunately the case in France, they
were impervious to a sense of duty, society must fall back upon the
landed proprietors, the employers, and persons of ripe judgment—men
who hardly deserve the title of savants, but nevertheless with
considerable experience of life. Failing these it could still appeal
to the local authorities, to those living nearest the persons concerned,
to the parish rather than the county, the county rather than the
State. State intervention is indispensable only when all other
authorities have failed—in the enforcement of Sunday observance,
for example, where the ruling classes have shown a disposition to
despise it. The necessity for State intervention is evidence of
disease within the State, and the degree of intervention affords some
index of the extent of the malady.<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p>Seeing that he attaches such importance to the constitution of
the family, Le Play is also bound to give equal prominence to the
question of entail, which determines the permanence of the family.
Herein lies the kernel of Le Play’s system. He distinguishes three
types of families:</p>

<p>1. The patriarchal family. The father is the sole proprietor, or,
more correctly, he is the chief administrator of all family affairs.
At his death all goods pass by full title to the eldest son. Such is
the most ancient form of government of which we have any
record. It is the political counterpart of the pastoral <i>régime</i>,
and both may still be seen in full operation on the Russian
steppes.</p>

<p>2. The family group. Children and grandchildren no longer
remain under paternal authority throughout life. With a single
exception they leave the family hearth and proceed to found new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
homes. Whoever remains at home becomes the heir, after first
becoming his father’s associate during the latter’s lifetime. He
becomes the new head of the family by paternal wish, and not of
legal right or necessity. The property thus passes to the worthiest,
to him who is thought best able to preserve it. It is this <i>régime</i>,
Le Play thinks, that explains the extraordinary stability of China;
and the same system, though somewhat shaken, is the source of
England’s strength and vitality. There were some parts of France
where, in spite of the Civil Code, a similar system was still in vogue.
There was one such family in particular, that of the Pyrenean
peasant Melouga, whose history showed a wonderful continuity,
and the story of that family recurs as a kind of <i>leitmotiv</i> through
the whole of the writings of Le Play and his immediate disciples.
The Melouga family has since become extinct.</p>

<p>3. The unstable family, where all the children, as soon as they
arrive at maturity, quit the home and set up for themselves. At
the father’s death the family, already scattered, is completely dissolved.
The patrimony is divided equally between all its members,
and any business which the father may have possessed, whether
agricultural or industrial, goes into immediate liquidation. This is
the <i>régime</i> born of individualism which is characteristic of all
modern societies, especially France.</p>

<p>Le Play’s sympathy is entirely with the second, for the family
group seems to hold the balance evenly between the two antagonistic
forces which are both indispensable for the welfare of society,
namely, the spirit of conservatism and the spirit of innovation.
Under the patriarchal system the former preponderates,<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> while
under the <i>régime</i> of the unstable family it is utterly wanting. The
latter reminds us of Penelope’s web—each generation making a
fresh beginning. But this periodical division of wealth fails to
give the desired degree of equality, for the removal of every
trace of solidarity between the members means that the one may
become rich and the other sink into poverty. Everyone fights for
his own hand. Moreover, when children only remain with their
parents for just a short period of tutelage there is a powerful incentive
given to race suicide, as is clearly shown in the case of France. As
soon as the offspring find themselves in a position of self-sufficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
they leave the old home, just as the young animal does. Under
such circumstances it is clearly to the interest of parents to have
as few children as possible.<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a></p>

<p>The family group, on the other hand, entrusts its traditions and
their preservation to the keeping of the child who remains at home.
Those who leave have their way to make, and become heirs of that
industrial spirit which has made England the mistress of the world.
True fraternal equality is also preserved, for the old home always
remains open—a harbour of refuge to those who fail in the industrial
struggle. To mention but one instance, the “old maid,” whose lot
is often exceedingly hard, need never be without a home.</p>

<p>Apart from moral reform, there seemed only one way of establishing
the family group in France, namely, by greater freedom of
bequest, or at the very least by increasing the amount of goods that
may be given to any one child, so that a father might be able to
transmit the whole of his land or his business to any one of his
children on condition that the heir fairly indemnified each of his
brothers should their respective shares be insufficient.<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<p>A father’s authority over his children is an indispensable element
in the stability of society, and a master’s authority over his men,
though derivative in character, is scarcely less so. The continuance
of social peace largely depends upon the latter, and the preservation
of social peace should be the essential aim of social science.<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> We
are continually meeting with the expression “social peace” in the
writings of Le Play and his school, and the associations which they
founded became known as “Unions of Social Peace.”</p>

<p>Play’s first essay, an admirably planned <i>Exposition of Social
Economics</i>, was published in 1867. The sole object of its author
was to further the establishment of such institutions as were likely
to promote understanding among all persons employed in the
production of the same goods. We might even be tempted to say
that the whole co-partnership movement started by Dollfus at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Mulhouse in 1850 with the utterance of the famous phrase, “The
master owes something to the worker beyond his mere wages,” was
inspired by Le Play.<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> Le Play pinned his faith to the benevolent
master. It was quite natural that the apostle of the family group
should regard the factory as possessing a great deal of the stability
and many of the other characteristics of the family, such as its quasi-permanent
engagements<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> and its various grades of working men
all grouped together under the authority of a well-respected chief.</p>

<p>Le Play’s thesis that the salvation of the working classes can
only come from above seems to have even less foundation than the
opposite doctrine of syndicalism, which claims that their deliverance
is in their own hands, and it was once for all refuted in a
brilliant passage of Stuart Mill’s:<a name="FNanchor_1042" id="FNanchor_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> “No times can be pointed out
in which the higher classes of this or any other country performed
a part even distantly resembling the one assigned them in this
theory. All privileged and powerful classes as such have used
their power in the interest of their own selfishness.… I do
not affirm that what has always been must always be. This at
least seems to be undeniable, that long before the superior classes
could be sufficiently inspired to govern in the tutelary manner
supposed, the inferior classes would be too much improved to be so
governed.”</p>

<p>Besides the master and the State there was still another factor
of social progress which is of prime importance at the present time,
namely, working men’s unions. One might reasonably have expected
a more sympathetic treatment for them at Le Play’s hands, especially
when we remember that they were proscribed by the “false dogmas
of ’89.” But he had little faith in union, whether a corporation or
a co-operative society.<a name="FNanchor_1043" id="FNanchor_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> Trade unionism especially seemed rather
useless, because it tended to destroy the more natural and more
efficient organisation which appeared to him to be merely an extension
of the family group. It is true that Le Play never saw unionism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
in operation, but it is hardly probable that he would have modified
his opinion. At any rate, the attitude of his disciples is not much
more favourable.</p>

<p>One feels tempted to say that there is nothing very new in all
this. The remark would have been particularly gratifying to Le
Play, who considered that invention was impossible in social
science and that what he himself had done was merely to make a
discovery.</p>

<p>The discovery of “the essential constitution of humanity,” as
he called it, was, he thought, the outcome of his methods of observation.
His method was really always more important than his
doctrine. It has always enjoyed a considerable measure of success,
and it seems to-day as if it would survive the doctrine. Le Play
was brought up as a mining engineer and had travelled extensively.<a name="FNanchor_1044" id="FNanchor_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>
Twenty years of his life had been spent in this way, and during
that period he had travelled over almost the whole of Europe, even
as far as the Urals. It was while staying in the neighbourhood of
those mountains that he conceived the idea of writing monographs
dealing with individual families belonging to the working classes,
a method of investigation which he is never weary of contrasting
with that other “disdainful method of invention.”<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></p>

<p>To write a family monograph<a name="FNanchor_1046" id="FNanchor_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> <i>à la</i> Le Play is not merely to relate
its history, to describe its mode of life, and to analyse its means of
subsistence, but also to sum up its daily life in a kind of double-entry
book-keeping where every item of expenditure is carefully
compared and balanced with the receipts. But there is much
that is artificial and a great deal that is childish in this seemingly
mathematical precision, where not merely economic wants but such
needs as those of education, of recreation, and of intemperance,
virtues as well as vices, are catalogued and reckoned in terms of
£ s. d. Its advantage lies in its holding the attention of the observer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
even when he is a mere novice at the work, by obliging him to put
something in every column and allowing nothing to escape his
notice.<a name="FNanchor_1047" id="FNanchor_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<p>But when Le Play proceeds to declare that this method has
revealed the truth to him and helped him to formulate the doctrines
of which we have just given a <i>résumé</i> it really seems as if he were
making a great mistake. Actually it has only revealed what Le Play
expected to find; in other hands it might have yielded quite different
results. He declares that it has proved to him that only those
families which are grouped under paternal authority and which obey
the Ten Commandments are really happy.<a name="FNanchor_1048" id="FNanchor_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> That may be, but
how would he define a happy family? “A happy family is one that
dwells in unity and abides in the love of God.” He has thus armed
himself with a definite <i>a priori</i> criterion of happiness;<a name="FNanchor_1049" id="FNanchor_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> but there
is nothing to prove that the unstable disorganised family of the
Parisian factory hand may not be infinitely more happy than the
family group of Melouga or the patriarchal family of the Bashkirs
of Turkestan.</p>

<p>A comparison has often been drawn between Le Play’s school
and the German Historical school. It is pointed out that both
schools lay great emphasis upon the method of observation and
focus attention upon the institutions of the past, and that to some
extent they both represent a reaction against Liberalism and Classical
optimism. But the resemblance is wholly superficial. At bottom
the two schools are not merely different, but even divergent. The
German school seeks the explanation of the present in the past,
while Le Play’s school is merely out to learn a few lessons. The
one studies the germ which is to develop and to bear fruit, while
the other admires the type and the model to which it thinks it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
necessary to conform. The one is evolutionary, the other traditional,
and the conclusions of the former are radical in the extreme, and
even socialistic, while those of the latter are usually conservative.</p>

<p>And so Play’s true position is in the chapter dealing with Social
Christianity, and not among the writers of the Historical school.</p>

<p>His unshaken belief in the natural propensity of man to evil
and error is sufficient to give him his place. But we must beware
of confusing his doctrine with that of the Social Catholics, for,
unlike them, he is rather prone to invoke the authority of the
Mosaic law, especially the Decalogue, and to take his illustrations
from England, which is a Protestant country, or from China or
Mohammedan lands. His importance among authorities on social
questions is not very great, but his attitude towards Church and
clergy was on the whole defiant,<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> and the plan of reform of which
we have just given an outline is very different from that of the
Social Catholics.</p>

<p>There was a schism in the school in 1885. The “Unions of Social
Peace,” with their organ, <i>La Réforme sociale</i>, have on the whole
remained faithful to the programme as outlined in this chapter.
The dissenting branch, on the other hand, with M. Demolins and
the Abbé de Tourville as leaders, has developed the doctrine on its
ultra-individualistic or Spencerian side, so that only in origin can it
be regarded as at all connected with the school of Le Play.</p>

<p>The “School of Social Science,” as it is called—at least, that is
the name it has given to its review—claims that it is still faithful to
the method of the master. It even goes so far as to say that Le Play
was ignorant of the full possibilities of this method, and condemns
his failure to establish a positive science by means of it. In reality,
however, the master’s method has quite a subordinate <i>rôle</i> in the
activities of this new school, for the simple reason that it is practically
useless except for the production of monographs. The new school
arranges its facts according to their natural relations, and attempts
to link the study of social science to the study of geographical
environment.<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> The study of environment receives some attention
in the works of Le Play himself, but it has assumed much greater
importance since then. To give but a single instance, the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
school attempts to show how the configuration of the Norwegian
fiord, the almost complete absence of arable land, and the consequent
recourse to fishing as a means of livelihood, even the very dimensions
of their sea-craft, have helped to fix the type of family and even the
political and economic constitutions prevalent among the Anglo-Saxon
race. In a similar fashion, the vast steppes of central and
southern Asia have begotten a civilisation of their own. It is
the Historical materialism of the Marxian school reappearing in
the more picturesque and more suggestive guise of geographical
determinism.<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a></p>

<p>The new school, however, is not very favourably inclined to
Le Play’s programme of social reform, especially its teaching concerning
the family. Their aim is not the preservation of the
family, but the placing of each child in a position to found a family
of his own as soon as possible. Their object is neither family
nor communal solidarity, but self-help, not the family group, but
the single individual family, not the English, but the American
home. Demolins is an ardent believer in the struggle for existence,
and no one has ever professed greater contempt for the solidarist
doctrine. “Social salvation, like eternal life,” says he, “is
essentially a personal affair”—a singularly heterodox declaration,
by the way, for if salvation is a purely personal matter of what use
is the Church?<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading66">II: SOCIAL CATHOLICISM</h4>

<p>The term “Catholic Socialism,” which is occasionally employed as
an alternative to the above title, is objected to by the majority
of Catholics as being excessively restrictive. The generic term
“Christian Socialism” was first employed by a Frenchman, Francis
Huet, in a book entitled <i>Le Règne social du Christianisme</i>, published
in 1853.<a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>But at least two other authors, namely, Buchez in his <i>Essai
d’un Traité complet de Philosophie au point de vue du Catholicisme
et du Progrès</i> (1838-40), and the fugitive Abbé de Lamennais in <i>La
Question du Travail</i> (1848), can lay considerable claims to priority
in the matter. Buchez was the founder of the Co-operative Association
of Producers (1832), and Lamennais outlined a scheme of
co-operative banks almost exactly like those afterwards established
in Germany by Raiffeisen.<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a></p>

<p>Present-day Catholicism, however, shows no great desire to honour
any of them. The one ambition of these three republicans was to
effect a union between the Church and the Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> The most
advanced of the Social Catholics of to-day, on the other hand, would
be well satisfied could they establish some kind of understanding
between the Church and democracy. Such at least is the programme
recently laid down by M. Marc Sangnier, the founder of the Sillon.</p>

<p>About the same time we find Monseigneur von Ketteler, Bishop
of Mayence, preaching a doctrine which drew its inspiration, not
from “the false dogmas of ’89,” but from the institutional life
of the Middle Ages, from the guilds and the other corporative
associations, which are minutely described by him and his disciples,
especially Canon Moufang and the Abbé Hitze. Some such institutional
activity was again to form the corner-stone of Social
Catholicism.<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>During the period of the Second Empire most of the Social
Catholics seem to have fallen asleep, but they were aroused from
their slumbers by the disaster of 1870. The Comte Albert de Mun
proved the inspirer this time, and his noble eloquence, which led
to the formation of unions of Catholic working men, was instrumental
in giving the movement a vigorous start. The same period
witnessed the appearance of <i>L’Association catholique</i>, a review which
took as its programme the study of economic facts in a Catholic
spirit—an object that has always been kept steadily in view.</p>

<p>Organisation in the form of corporations was given first place in
the Social Catholic programme.<a name="FNanchor_1058" id="FNanchor_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> Le Play’s corner-stone—the family
organisation—was not rejected, but they considered that though
the family was to remain the basis for moral reform a wider association
of an economic character must serve as a basis for economic
reform.</p>

<p>At first sight this may seem somewhat surprising. The connection
between these professional associations and the teaching of
the Gospel is not very evident, nor is it very clear how such organisations
could ever hope to Christianise society. But although the
Gospels know nothing of a corporative or any other <i>régime</i> we must
not forget their prominence during the Middle Ages—when the
authority of the Church was in the ascendant. As long as this
<i>régime</i> lasted what we understand as the social question—the vexed
problem as to whether we possess sufficient moral strength to
keep the peace between capital and labour—never presented itself.
The problem is, of course, somewhat different to-day, but its solution
may possibly require the exercise of similar virtues, namely, obedience
to a detailed system of organisation coupled with a feeling of brotherhood—the
chastening of the whole complexity of social relations by
the spirit of Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of their opponents have not hesitated to charge these
Catholics with a desire to return to the feudalism of the Middle Ages,
which is of course utterly false. What the Social Catholics wished
to do was to build up the new social structure upon the basis of
the modern trade union, or upon syndicalism; and the proof
that the foundation is not at any rate too narrow lies in the
fact that the new schools of socialists can conceive of none better.
With this as the foundation they looked forward not merely to
the development of a new society, but also to the rise of a
new ethic. The fact that they forestalled the socialists in this
respect shows that the Social Catholics were at least not hopelessly
antiquated.</p>

<p>Early in the history of the movement they tried to organise a
kind of mixed <i>syndicat</i> consisting both of masters and men, because
this seemed to them to offer the best guarantee for social peace.
But the results proved disappointing, and they were soon forced to
relinquish that idea and to content themselves with a separate
organisation of masters and men co-operating only in matters
relating to the regulation of work or the settling of differences.<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>
Such collateral unions, it was at first thought, would gradually
become the organs of labour legislation, and the State would entrust
them with the discharge of that function because of their greater
freedom in the making of experiments. All questions affecting
the interests of a trade, the hours of labour, Sunday observance,
apprenticeship, the sanitary condition of the workshops, the labour
of women and children, and even the rate of wages paid, instead
of being regulated as they are at present by brutal, inflexible laws
which are seldom suited to meet every individual case, would
henceforth be settled by the union, and the rules of the union would
be incumbent upon all the members of the trade or profession,
both masters and men. Everyone would be free to enter the union
or to decline membership just as he chose, but no member would be
allowed to violate the rules of the union or to lower the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
of labour in any way. “Free association within an organised
profession,” such is the formula.<a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a></p>

<p>To those Liberals who feign indignation at seeing purely private
institutions thus invested with legislative authority it may be
answered that the “labour union” so constituted forms an association
which is as natural and as necessary—understanding by this
that it is independent of the voluntary conventions of the parties
interested—as one based upon community of residence. Everybody
admits that the inhabitants of the commune ought to submit to
the rule of the organised majority. What difference would it make
if the majority thus organised constituted a corporation rather
than a commune?<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></p>

<p>Some go so far as to regard these professional associations
as possessed of an important political <i>rôle</i>, and would even go the
length of making this new corporative unit the basis of a new franchise
for the election of at least one of the two Chambers.</p>

<p>It is not very easy, perhaps, to get a clear idea of what a society
built upon a plan of this kind would really be like, but the difficulty
is no greater in this case than in some others.</p>

<p>In the first place it would have to be a society professing the
Catholic faith.<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> Should the enemies of religion or even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
indifferent by any chance ever gain the upper hand in the social unit
the whole structure would immediately fall to the ground. Its
realisation, accordingly, is quite hypothetical.</p>

<p>It would also be a society founded upon brotherhood in the full
sense of the term. The only real brotherhood is that founded
upon the fatherhood of God, and not upon any socialistic conception
of equality. But even brotherhood and a common parentage may
not be sufficient to prevent irregularities, and the family relation
in addition to this almost inevitably implies the rights of the
youngest and the duties of the oldest. Within the corporative unit
already outlined true equality would always reign, for the humblest,
meanest task would be of equal dignity with the most exalted
office in the State, and everyone would be content and even proud
to live where God had placed him.<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a></p>

<p>Such a society would be a pure hierarchy. All the authority
and responsibility, all the duties involved, would be on the master’s
side. On the worker’s side would be rights respected, life assured
on the minimum level, and a re-establishment of family life.<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>

<p>Social Catholicism further undertook to disprove the first article
in the socialist creed, namely, that “the emancipation of the workers
can only be accomplished by the workers themselves.” It maintained
that, on the contrary, this object could only be accomplished
by the help of the masters and of all the other classes in society,
not excluding even the non-professional classes, landed proprietors,
rent-receivers, and consumers generally,<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> all of whom ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
informed of the responsibilities which their different positions
impose upon them and of the special duty which is incumbent upon
all men of making the most of the talents with which the Master
has entrusted them.</p>

<p>The German Christliche Gewerkvereine, which gets most of its
recruits among the Catholics, is already taking an important part
in German political life and is doing something to counterbalance
the “Reds,” or the revolutionary socialists. They advocate the union
of masters and men, but are extremely anxious not to be confused
with the “Yellows,” or those who advocate mixed unions. In other
words, they are independent both of the masters and the socialists.</p>

<p>State intervention might be necessary at first in order to establish
the corporative <i>régime</i>, but once founded it would naturally
monopolise all the legislative and police power which affects labour
in any way, especially in the matter of fixing wages,<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> arranging
pensions, etc. The legislature would still find ample material to
exercise its powers upon outside these merely professional interests,
especially in regulating the rights of property, prohibiting usury,
protecting agriculture, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a></p>

<p>“The State,” says the <i>Immortale Dei</i>, an Encyclical of Pope
Leo XIII—repeating a text of St. Paul—“is the minister of God
for good.” Elsewhere St. Paul declares that the Law is the
schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, and if we paraphrase this to
mean that the function of law is to lead men to a higher conception
of brotherhood we have a fairly exact idea of what Social Catholicism
considered to be the function of the State. Occasionally the party
has betrayed signs of more advanced tendencies which would bring
it more into line with modern socialism. But for the most part
such indications have been of the nature of individual utterances,
which have generally resulted in the formal disapproval of Rome
and the submission of the rebel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>It was M. Loesewitz in 1888 who made the first violent attack
upon the so-called productivity theory of capital in <i>L’Association
catholique</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> It caused quite a sensation at the time, and provoked
a disapproving reply from the Comte de Mun. Afterwards, however,
the article became the programme of a party known as “Les jeunes
Abbés.” Nor must we omit to mention the growth of the Sillon,
founded in 1890, the political ambition of whose members is the
reconciliation of the Church and democracy and even republicanism,
and whose economic aim is the abolition of the wage-earner and his
master.<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> This is also the aim of the syndicalists, and Article 2 of
the Confédération générale du Travail (C.G.T.) declares that one of
the avowed objects of the federation is the disappearance of the
wage-earner and the removal of his master. Instead of seeking a
solution of the problem in the parallel action of <i>syndicats</i> of men
on the one hand and of masters on the other, it would suppress the
latter altogether, leaving the men the right of possessing their own
instruments of production and of keeping intact the produce of their
labour. It is true that the Sillon is under the ban of the Pope, but
this essentially syndicalist movement is still in existence.</p>

<p>If the Catholic school has experienced some difficulty in throwing
out a left wing it has never been without a right wing which has
always shown a predilection for the masters. “The problem is not
how to save the worker through his own efforts, but how to save
him with the master’s co-operation”—the benevolent master of
Le Play’s school over again.<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> The right wing, moreover, thinks that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
the existing institutions would prove quite equal to a solution of the
so-called social question if they were once thoroughly permeated
with the Christian spirit or if the leaders really knew how to deal
with the people.</p>

<h4 id="heading67">III: SOCIAL PROTESTANTISM</h4>

<p>Belief in the essentially individualistic nature of Protestantism
is fairly widespread.<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> For confirmation there is the emphasis it has
always laid upon the personal nature of salvation and its denial of
the necessity for any mediator between God and man, save only
the Man Christ Jesus, whereas Roman Catholicism teaches that only
through the Church—that great community of the faithful—is salvation
ever possible. Protestantism is the religion of self-help, and
naturally enough its social teaching is somewhat coloured by its
theological preconceptions. Nor must we lose sight of its connection
with middle-class Liberalism; and thus while in politics it
is generally regarded as belonging to the left, in matters economic it
is generally on the extreme right.<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

<p>Whatever truth there may be in this attempt to sum up its
doctrine and history, we shall find as a matter of actual fact that on
economic grounds it is much more advanced than the Social Catholic
school; and its extreme left, far from being content with the extinction
of the proletariat, also demands the abolition of private property
and the establishment of complete communal life.</p>

<p>Social Protestantism, or Christian Socialism as it is known in
England, has a birthday which may be determined with some degree
of accuracy. It was in the year 1850 that there was founded in
England a society for promoting working men’s associations, having
for its organ a paper entitled <i>The Christian Socialist</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Its best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
known representatives were Kingsley and Maurice, who subsequently
became respectively professors of history and philosophy at Cambridge.
A small number of lawyers also joined the society, among
whom Ludlow, Hughes, and Vansittart Neale are the most familiar
names. Kingsley was much in the public eye just then, not only
because of his impassioned eloquence, but also on account of the
success of his novel <i>Alton Locke</i>, which is perhaps the earliest piece of
socialistic fiction that we possess. It is the story of a journeyman
tailor and his sufferings under the sweating system—the horrors
of which were thus revealed to the public for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a></p>

<p>The object which the Christian Socialists<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> had in view, as we
have already seen, was the establishment of working men’s associations.
What type they should adopt as their model was not very
easily determined. The trade unions, little known as yet, were just
then struggling through the convulsions of their early infancy.
Moreover, they were exclusively concerned with professional matters,
with the struggle for employment and the question of wages, and
altogether did not seem very well fitted to develop the spirit of
sacrifice and love which was indispensable for the realisation of
their ideal. Neither did the co-operative associations of consumers
seem very attractive. True they had attained to some degree of
success at Rochdale, but they were inspired by the teaching of
Owen, which was definitely anti-Christian. The fact also that they
merely proposed to make life somewhat less costly and a little more
comfortable implied a certain measure of stoicism which hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
fitted them to be the chosen vessels of the new dispensation. And
so the Christian Socialists naturally turned their attention to producers’
associations, just as the earliest Social Catholics had done
before them. But it would be a mistake to imagine that they owed
anything to Buchez, whom they appear to have ignored altogether.
The reawakened interest in the possibilities of association which
exercised such a fascination over John Stuart Mill in 1848 had
touched their imagination, and Ludlow, one of their number, had
the good fortune to be resident in Paris, and so witnessed this glorious
revival. Such associations seemed to be just the economic instruments
needed if a transformation was ever to be effected, and the
very process of establishing them, it was hoped, would supply
a useful means of discipline in the subordination of individual to
collective interests. But the process of disillusion proved as rapid
as it was complete. Contrary to what was the case in France, it
cannot be said that they were ever really attempted in England.</p>

<p>But the work of the “Association” had not been altogether in
vain. Defeated in its attempts to arouse the worker from his lethargy,
and thwarted in its efforts by legal restrictions of various kinds, it
began a campaign in favour of a more liberal legislation in matters
affecting the welfare of the working classes. The result was the
passing of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts of 1852-62,
which conferred legal personality for the first time upon co-operative
associations, with consequent benefit to themselves and to other
working men’s associations.</p>

<p>The Christian Socialists thought that the methods by which their
ideals might be attained were of quite secondary importance. Experience
had taught them that voluntary association or legislation
even by itself could never be of much avail until the whole mental
calibre of the worker was changed.<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> What they strove for above
all else was moral reform, and whenever they use the word “co-operation”
they conceive of it not merely as a particular system
of industry, but rather as the antithesis of the competitive <i>régime</i>
or as the negation of the struggle for existence. Their thoughts are
admirably summed up in a letter of Ludlow’s to Maurice written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
from Paris in March 1848, in which he speaks of the necessity for
“Christianising socialism.”</p>

<p>Christian Socialism in England, though it has survived its
founders, has been obliged to change its programme. It has
abandoned the idea of a producers’ association, but still advocates
other forms of co-operation. Just now its chief demand is for a
reorganisation of private property, which is a particularly serious
question in England, where the land is in the hands of a comparatively
few people. In the words of the Psalmist, the Christian Socialists
often cry out, “The earth is the Lord’s,” and they are never weary of
pointing out how under the Mosaic law the land was redistributed
every forty-nine years with a view to bringing it back to its original
owners. And so it finds itself supporting the doctrines of Henry
George, who may himself be classed as one of the Christian Socialists.<a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>
There is also the Institutional Church, with its network of organisations
for the satisfaction of the material, intellectual, and moral needs
of the worker, which is becoming a prominent feature of modern
English Church life. Moreover, several of the Labour leaders—Keir
Hardie, for example—are earnest Christians. The Federation of
Brotherhoods, which to-day includes over 2000 societies, with a
membership of over a million working men, combines an ardent
evangelical faith with a strong advocacy of socialism.<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a></p>

<p>In the United States of America Christian Socialism is still more
aggressive and outspoken in its attacks upon capitalism. The
earliest society of Christian Socialists was founded at Boston in
1889. Since then these associations have multiplied rapidly. The
latest of them defines its objects in the following terms: “To help
the message of Jesus to permeate the Christian Churches and to
show that socialism is necessarily the economic expression of the
Christian life.” A little farther on it declares itself persuaded
“that the ideal of socialism is identical with that of the Church,
and that the gospel of the co-operative commonwealth is the Gospel
of the Kingdom of God translated into economic terms.”<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>For the other extreme—the extreme right—we must look to
Germany. In 1878 Pastors Stöcker and Todt founded the Christian
Social Working Men’s Party, which, despite its title, drew most of
its recruits from the middle classes. Later on Stöcker became
Court preacher, and during his occupation of that post this kind of
socialism found such favour in official quarters that he was able to
say that it was his personal conviction that a social revolution
was within the bounds of practical politics.<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> But in 1890 the
Emperor William II dismissed his pastor, and Christian Socialism
immediately lost its official status.<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p>At the Congress of Erfurt in 1896 two young pastors of Frankfort
named Naumann and Goehre<a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> tried to win the adherence of the
working classes by endeavouring to give the Protestant churches a
more distinctively socialist bias. But the suggestion was condemned
by the official Lutheran Church, the masters opposed it, and it
received but very slight support from the Social Democrats. Altogether
the movement proved abortive, and the pastors have long
since turned aside to other interests.</p>

<p>In Switzerland also the movement is making considerable
headway, and in Professor Ragaz and Pastors Kutter<a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> and Pflüger,
the latter of whom has recently been made a deputy, it has found
advocates whose views are at any rate sufficiently advanced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>In France there is at least one—there may possibly be more—Social
Protestant school. But as it only includes a small fraction of
Protestantism, which is itself in a hopeless minority, its influence is
not very great. There are several important social movements,
however, such as the crusades against alcoholism and pornography,
the revival of co-operation and the demand for the erection of
“People’s Palaces”—known as <i>Solidarités</i>—which are entirely
due to the activities of this school. An association for the
inductive study of social questions was founded in 1887 by Pastor
Gouth, another pastor named Tomy Fallot being its president and
inspirer.<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> At first the demands of this group were extremely
moderate, co-operation being their only mode of action and solidarity
their social doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> This new doctrine of solidarity, although
rather belonging to the Radical wing, being the very antithesis of
Christian charity, as we shall see by and by, has been enthusiastically
welcomed by the Social Protestants. The Protestants even claim
that it was originally their own peculiar doctrine, and that other
schools merely borrowed it; for where can be found a fuller expression
of the law of solidarity than the two Christian doctrines of the
fall and redemption of man? “For as in Adam all die, even so in
Christ shall all be made alive.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough there is another group of young pastors who
closely resemble what is known in Catholic circles as the Abbots’ Party.
They are dissatisfied with the moderate claims of the Catholics as a
whole, and like their American colleagues they demand the establishment
of a form of collectivism.<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> They think, at any rate, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
question of property ought to come up for consideration almost
immediately.</p>

<p>In short, it seems true to say that in almost every country Social
Christianity is gradually evolving into Christian Socialism, and the
change of title is an index to the difference of attitude. In other
words, Social Protestantism accepts the essential principles of
international socialism, such as the socialisation of the means of
production, class war, and internationalism, and endeavours to show
that they are in complete accordance with the teaching of the
Gospels.</p>

<p>But the stress which it lays upon the necessity for moral reform
saves Social Protestantism from being hopelessly confused with
collectivism, and the fact that it believes that individual salvation
is impossible without social transformation helps to distinguish it
from individual Protestantism.<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> Conversion implies a change of
environment. What is the use of preaching chastity when people
have to sleep together in the same room without distinction of age
or of sex? “Society,” says Fallot, “ought to be organised in such
a fashion that salvation is at least possible for everyone.” “The
<i>régime</i> of the great industry,” says M. Gounelle, “is the greatest
obstacle to the salvation of sinners that the religion of Christ
has yet met.” Protestant Socialism remains individualistic in the
sense that while seeking to suppress individualism in the form of
egoism as a centripetal force, it wishes to uphold it and to strengthen
it as a principle of disinterested activity—as a centrifugal force. It
takes for its motto those words of Vinet which may be found carved
on the pedestal of his statue at Lausanne: “I want man to be his
own master in order that he may give better service to everybody
else.”<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="heading68">IV: THE MYSTICS</h4>

<p>No review of Christian Social doctrines, however summary, can
afford to omit the names of certain eminent writers who, though
belonging to none of the above-mentioned schools, and having no
definite standing either as socialists or economists, being for the
most part <i>littérateurs</i>, historians, and novelists, have nevertheless
lent the powerful support of their eloquence to the upholding of
somewhat similar doctrines.<a name="FNanchor_1089" id="FNanchor_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<p>Tolstoy and Ruskin are the best known representatives of this
movement on the borderland of Social Christianity, although they
are by no means the only ones.<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> These two grand old men, who
both died at an advanced age, appeared to their contemporaries in
much the same light as the prophets of old did to Israel. True
descendants of Isaiah and Jeremiah, they exultantly prophesied the
downfall of capitalism—the modern Tyre and Sidon—and announced
the coming of the New Jerusalem—the habitation of justice. Their
language even is modelled on Holy Writ, and Ruskin, we know, was
from his youth upwards a diligent reader of the Bible.<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> Both of
them condemn the Hedonistic principle and denounce money as an
instrument of tyranny which has resulted in setting up something
like a new system of slavery,<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> and they both advocate a return to
manual labour as the only power that can free the individual and
regenerate social life. They differ, however, in their conception of
future society, which to Ruskin must be aristocratic, chivalrous, and
heroic, while Tolstoy lays stress upon its being equalitarian, communal,
and above all ethical. The one looks at society from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
standpoint of an æsthete, the other from that of a <i>muzhik</i>: the one
would breed heroes, the other saints.</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle also deserves mention. Among the numerous
books which he wrote we may mention, among others, his <i>French
Revolution</i> (1837) and his <i>Heroes and Hero-worship</i>. Chronologically
he precedes both Tolstoy and Ruskin, and his influence upon
economic thought was greater than either of theirs. But we
could hardly put him among the Christian Socialists because of his
extreme individualism, and if he were to be given a place at all it
would be with such writers as Ibsen and Nietzsche. His economic
ideas, however, run parallel to Ruskin’s; and nowhere except
perhaps in the choruses of the old Greek tragedies do we get anything
approaching the passion which is displayed in their declamations
against the present economic order.<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

<p>Carlyle is possibly the strongest adversary that the old Classical
school ever encountered. It was he who spoke of political economy
as “the dismal science.” That abstract creation of the Classicists,
the economic man, afforded him endless amusement, and he very
aptly described their ideal State as “anarchy plus the policeman.”
He is no less fierce in his denunciation of <i>laissez-faire</i> as a
social philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> But he left us no plan of social reconstruction,
being himself content to wait upon individual reform—a trait which
brings him into intimate connection with the Christian Socialists.<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a></p>

<p>Ruskin, on the other hand, has given us a programme of social
regeneration which might be summarised as follows:<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a></p>

<p>1. Manual labour should be compulsory for everybody. His
readers were reminded of those words of St. Paul, “If any would
not work, neither should he eat.” He thought it both absurd and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
immoral that a man should live in idleness merely by using money
inherited from his ancestors to pay for the services of his fellow-men.
Life is the only real form of payment; in other words, labour ought
to be given in return for labour. To <i>live</i> upon the fruits of <i>dead</i>
labour is surely absurd and contradictory. And it must be real
human labour. Machinery of all kinds must be renounced except
that which may be driven by wind or water—natural forces which,
unlike coal, do not defile, but rather purify.</p>

<p>Ruskin wanted labour to be artistic, and he longed to see the
artisan again become an artist as he was in the Middle Ages (which is
a somewhat hasty generalisation perhaps). In practice this is not
very easy. Some of his immediate disciples have set up as artistic
bookbinders, but the number of people who can find employment
at such trades must be exceedingly few.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, on the other hand, does not strive for artistic effect.
His heart is set upon rural work, which he magnificently describes as
“bread work,” and which seemed to him sufficiently noble without
embellishment of any kind.</p>

<p>2. Work for everyone is the natural complement and the necessary
corrective of the preceding rule of no idleness and no unemployment.
In society as at present organised everybody is not
obliged to work, while some individuals are obliged to be idle.<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> This
monstrous inequality must be remedied. There would be no
difficulty about finding plenty of work for everyone if everyone did
something. Under such a system there would be no unemployment,
although there would be more leisure for some.</p>

<p>3. Labour would no longer be paid for according to the exigencies
of demand and supply, which tend to reduce manual work to the
level of a mere commodity. It would be remunerated according to
the eternal principles of justice, which would not of necessity imply an
appeal to any written law, but solely to custom, which even now
fixes the salaries of doctors, lawyers, and professors. In these
professions there are no doubt some individual inequalities, but
there is also the norm, and it is a breach of professional etiquette
to take less than this. The norm does occasionally find expression
in the rules of the association, and in some such way Ruskin would
fix not merely a minimum but also a maximum wage. Whatever
profession a person follows, whether he be workman, soldier, or
merchant, he should always work not merely for profit but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
social good. He must, of course, be suitably rewarded if his position
as a worker is to be maintained and the work itself efficiently
performed, but it can never be done if gain becomes the end and
labour merely the means.</p>

<p>4. The natural sources of wealth—land, mines, and waterfalls—and
the means of communication should be nationalised.</p>

<p>5. A social hierarchy graded according to the character of the
services rendered should be established. The gradation must be
accepted in no intolerant spirit, and must be respected by everybody.
Chivalry is as necessary in an industrial as in a military society, and
a new crusade against Mammonism<a name="FNanchor_1098" id="FNanchor_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> should be preached both far
and wide.</p>

<p>6. Above all else must come education—not mere instruction.
What needs developing above everything is a sense of greatness, a
love of beauty, respect for authority, and a passion for self-sacrifice.
What especially need acquiring are the faculties of admiration, of
hope, and of love.<a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p>Only the last item on the programme seems anywhere near
realisation, but that by itself would justify our reference to Ruskin’s
scheme. Not only has the suggestion resulted in the creation of
working men’s colleges at Oxford and of Ruskin Colleges elsewhere,
but it has also given rise to the garden city movement. These
new cities are built with the express purpose of relieving the worst
features of industrial life, and are so planned as not to interfere in
any way either with the beauties of nature or with the health of
the citizens.<a name="FNanchor_1100" id="FNanchor_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a></p>

<p>Ruskin speaks of himself somewhere as an out-and-out communist,
but his communism had also a touch of the aristocrat and
the æsthete about it which possibly proved a recommendation in
English society. Tolstoy is a much more thoroughgoing communist,
and is violently opposed to “that low, bestial instinct which
men call the right of private property.”<a name="FNanchor_1101" id="FNanchor_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> His cry was “Back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
land,” and the practice of coaration; his ideal the mir. He was
not anxious to know that everyone was working at some trade or
other, but he thought everyone ought to produce his own food,
which is the one inevitable law of human existence. Division of
labour, which has been so extravagantly praised by economists, he
thought of as a mere machination of the devil enabling men to evade
the Divine commandment. At any rate it should only be adopted
when the need for it arises, and after consultation with all the parties
interested, and not indiscriminately, as is at present the case, with
competition, over-production, and crises as the result.<a name="FNanchor_1102" id="FNanchor_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

<p>If we are to take Tolstoy’s words literally, as he suggested we
should take Christ’s words, then the society that he dreamt of is
very far beyond even the communist ideal. More towns, more
commerce, more subdivision of trades, more money, more art for
art’s sake—such was to be the economic Nirvana of the communists.</p>

<h2 id="BOOK_V_RECENT_DOCTRINES">BOOK V: RECENT DOCTRINES</h2>

<p>In the earlier sections of this work no special difficulty was experienced
in giving the essential traits of the economic thought of each
period. But on the threshold of this last book we naturally feel
some trepidation. The newer theories can scarcely be said to have
fallen into their true perspective, and their full import is not clear
to us contemporaries. Here, if anywhere, we shall run the risk of
being arbitrary in our choice. It seems to us, however, that the
economic thought of the end of the nineteenth and the beginning
of the twentieth centuries reveals at least four dominant tendencies.</p>

<p>1. In the first place there is a quite unexpected revival of
theoretical studies. Pure economic theory, which had been deliberately
neglected by the Historical school, by the State and
Christian Socialists, was in 1875 again taken up by a group of eminent
writers who flourished in England, France, and Austria. With the
aid of conceptions that had not been in current use since the days of
Condillac, coupled with the application of the mathematical
method, which had not been attempted since the time of Cournot,
they have succeeded in substituting an attractive and ingenious
theory of prices for the somewhat halting hypothesis put forth by
the Classical theorists. The success of the method in other fields
of economic inquiry is every day enhancing its reputation. A
number of writers both in America and Europe (excepting France,
perhaps) are engaged upon this task, following in the wake of
Walras, of Jevons, and of Menger. Diagrams, algebraical formulæ,
and subtle reasoning again characterise the works of economists.
Pure economics, so much decried since the days of Ricardo, has
once more justified its claim to a position of honour, and despite
keen opposition it is attracting attention everywhere. From the
point of view of economic science this is the most notable fact of
recent years.</p>

<p>2. Parallel with this has gone on a profound change in socialism.
We have already shown in the course of the preceding book the
transformations undergone by Marx’s ideas at the hands of even
his own followers. The decline is equally evident everywhere else.
All pretension to set up a proletarian in opposition to a <i>bourgeois</i>
economics has been renounced. “It is necessary,” says M. Sorel
somewhere, “to abandon every thought of transforming socialism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
into a science.” In fact, French syndicalists, English Fabians,
and German revisionists have rallied with more or less good grace
to the scientific ideas of Pareto, Marshall, or Böhm-Bawerk. But
the real reason for this change of attitude is the strong desire to
devote themselves with greater vigour to the social and political
demands of socialism. The general strike, the creation of <i>syndicats</i>,
the establishment of co-operative societies, and the problems of
municipal socialism are attracting more and more attention, whereas
the theory of surplus value is falling into the background. Even
more striking still, as we shall see, is the attempt made by some
of them, especially the advocates of land nationalisation—to reconcile
Liberalism and socialism upon the basis of a doctrine that is
Classical <i>par excellence</i>—the theory of rent.</p>

<p>3. This is not the only change that socialism has undergone.
The ideal of collectivism which long prevailed among the working
classes was that of a centralised sovereign authority, and the active
part taken by the collectivist party in the legislative and even in the
administrative work of some countries still further encouraged this
belief. But the old revolutionary spirit, always individualistic to
the core, was still alive, especially in the Latin countries, and it
began to show signs of impatience at the turn things had taken.
And so we witness among the working classes a revival of Liberalism,
harsh and violent in its expression perhaps, and doubtless very
different from the founders’. Smith and Bastiat would have some
difficulty in recognising it, and with a view to avoiding confusion
with the older doctrine it has assumed the name <i>libertaire</i>, but is
generally known by the no less authentic title of “anarchism.” This
tendency towards extreme individualism and anarchy, of which there
is unmistakable evidence even in the annals of the International, has
gained the ascendancy over the working classes, leaving a deep
mark upon the recent syndicalist movement in France and Italy.
At the same time there has also appeared among writers of the
<i>bourgeois</i> class a kind of philosophical and moral anarchism which
affords further proof of the revival of individualism.</p>

<p>4. Owing to these transformations in the theories of individualism
and socialism, that other doctrine which in an earlier book went by
the name of State Socialism has also undergone a change. In
France, at any rate, it has reappeared under the name of Solidarism,
which attempts a justification of State intervention by basing
it on new foundations and confining it within just limits. It
thus really represents an effort at synthesising individualism and
socialism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>These are the main currents which we have attempted to describe
in the following chapters. By describing them as recent doctrines
our aim was not to emphasise the date of their appearance—which
indeed is often in the distant past—but to show that they are merely
a fresh effort to rejuvenate the older theories of which they are
the latest manifestation. We might perhaps have borrowed a term
from another domain and referred to them as modernist doctrines
did it not seem rash to group under a perfectly definite term conceptions
that are so very diverse in character and which have nothing
more than a chronological order binding them together.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I_THE_HEDONISTS">CHAPTER I: THE HEDONISTS</h3>

<h4 id="heading69">I: THE PSEUDO-RENAISSANCE OF THE
CLASSICAL SCHOOL</h4>

<p>If we are to give this new doctrine its true setting we must return
for a moment to our study of the Historical school. The criticism
of that school, as we have already seen, was directed chiefly against
the method of the Classical writers. The faith which their predecessors
had placed in the permanence and universality of natural
law was scornfully rejected, and the possibility of ever founding a
science upon a chain of general propositions emphatically denied.
Political economy, so it was decreed, was henceforth to be concerned
merely with the classification of observed facts.</p>

<p>It would not have been difficult to foretell that the swing of the
pendulum—in accordance with that strange rhythm which is such
a feature of the history of thought—would at the opportune moment
cause a reversion to the abstract method. That is exactly what
happened. Just at the moment when Historical study seemed to
be triumphantly forging ahead—that is, about the years 1872-74—several
eminent economists in Austria, England, Switzerland, and
America suddenly and simultaneously made their appearance with
an emphatic demand that political economy should be regarded
as an independent science. They brought forward the claims
of what they called pure economics. Naturally enough there
ensued the keenest controversy between the champions of the
two schools, notably between Professors Schmoller and Karl
Menger.</p>

<p>The new school had one distinctive characteristic. In its search
for a basis upon which to build the new theory it hit upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
general principle that man always seeks pleasure and avoids pain,
getting as much of the former with as slight a dilution of the
latter as he possibly can.<a name="FNanchor_1103" id="FNanchor_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> A fact of such great importance and
one that was not confined to the field of economic activities, but
seemed present everywhere throughout nature in the guise of the
principle of least resistance, could scarcely have escaped the notice
of the Classical theorists. They had referred to it simply as
“personal interest,” but to-day we speak of it as Hedonism,
from the Greek ἠδονή (pleasure or agreeableness). Hence the
name Hedonists, by which we have chosen to designate these two
schools.</p>

<p>The elimination of all motives affecting human action except
one does not imply any desire on the part of these writers to deny
the existence of others. They simply lay claim to the right of
abstraction, without which no exact science could ever be constituted.
In other words, they demand the right of eliminating
from the field of research every element other than the one which
they wish to examine. The study of the other motives belongs to
the province of other social sciences. The <i>homo œconomicus</i> of the
Classicals which has been the object of so much derision has been
replaced on its pedestal. But it has in the meantime undergone
such a process of simplification that it is scarcely better than a
mere abstraction. Men are again to be treated as forces and
represented by curves or figures as in treatises on mechanics. The
object of the study is to determine the interaction of men among
themselves, and their reaction upon the external world.</p>

<p>We shall also find that the new schools arrive at an almost
identical conclusion with the old, namely, that absolutely free
competition alone gives the maximum of satisfaction to everybody.
Allowing for the differences in their respective points of view, to
which we shall refer later on, what is this but simply a revival of
the great Classical tradition?</p>

<p>Little wonder, then, that we find a good deal of sympathy shown
for the old Classical school. Indeed, it is throughout regarded with

<p>This does not mean that the Classical doctrine is treated as
being wholly beyond reproach, although it does mean that the
new school could scarcely accuse it of being in error, seeing that
it comes to similar conclusions itself. But what it does lay to the
charge of the older writers is a failure to prove what they assumed
to be true and a tendency to be satisfied with a process of reasoning
which too often meant wandering round in a hopeless circle.
Especially was this the case with their study of causal relations,
forgetting that as often as not cause was effect and effect cause.
The attempt to determine which is cause and which effect is clearly
futile, and the science must rest content with the discovery of
uniformities either of sequence or of coexistence.</p>

<p>This applies especially to the three great laws which form the
framework of economic science, namely, the law of demand and
supply, the law of cost of production, and the law of distribution,
none of which is independent of the others. Let us review them
briefly.</p>

<p>The law stating that “price varies directly with demand and
inversely with supply” possessed just that degree of mathematical
precision necessary to attract the attention of the new writers. In
fact, it just served for the passage from the old to the new economics.
But no sooner was the crossing effected than the bridge was destroyed.
Little difficulty was experienced in pointing out that this so-called
law which had been considered to be one of the axioms of political
economy, the <i>quid inconcussum</i> upon which had been raised all the
superstructure of economic theory, was an excellent example of that
circular reasoning of which we have just spoken. There was a
considerable flutter among the economists of the mid-nineteenth
century when they found themselves forced to recognise this.
However true it may be that price is determined by demand and
supply, it is equally true that demand and supply are each in their
turn determined by the price, so that it is impossible to tell which
is cause or which is effect. Stuart Mill had already noted this
contradiction, and had attempted correction in the way already
described (p. 359). But he was ignorant of the fact that Cournot
had completely demolished the formula by setting up another in its
place, namely, that “demand is a function of price.”<a name="FNanchor_1105" id="FNanchor_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> The substitution
of that formula marks the inauguration of the Hedonistic
calculus. Demand is now shown to be connected with price by a
kind of see-saw movement, falling when prices rise and rising when
prices fall. Supply is equally a function of price, but it operates in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
the opposite fashion, moving <i>pari passu</i> with it—rising as it rises
and falling as it falls. Thus price, demand, and supply are like
three sections of one mechanism, none of which can move in
isolation, and the problem is to determine the law of their interdependence.</p>

<p>This does not by any means imply that there is no longer any
place in economics for the law of demand and supply. It has
merely been given a new significance, and the usual way of expressing
it nowadays is by means of a supply and demand curve, which
simply involves translating Cournot’s dictum into figures.</p>

<p>The same is true of the law stating that cost of production
determines value. There is the same <i>petitio principii</i> here. It is
easy enough to see, on the contrary, that the <i>entrepreneur</i> regulates
his cost of production according to price. The Classical school
had realised this as far as one of the elements in the cost of production
was concerned, for it was quite emphatic in its teaching
that price determined rent, but that rent did not determine price.
It is just as true of the other elements. In other words, the second
law is just as fallible as the first. It is obviously imperative that
the vain quest for causal relations should be abandoned and that
economists should be content with the statement that between
cost of production and price there exists a kind of equilibrating
action in virtue not of any mysterious solidarity which subsists
between them, but because the mere absence of equilibrium due
either to a diminution or an increase in the quantity of products
immediately sets up forces which tend to bring it back to a position
of equilibrium. This interdependent relation, which is extremely
important in itself and upon which the Hedonists lay great store,
is simply one example taken from among many where the value
of one thing is just a function of another.</p>

<p>Similar criticism applies to the law of distribution, to the
Classical doctrine of wages, interest, and rent. The way the Classical
writers treated of these questions was extraordinarily naïve. Take
the question of rent. You just subtract from the total value of
the product wages, interest, and profit, and you are left with
rent. Or take the question of profit. In this case you will have
to subtract rent, if there is any, then wages and interest, the other
component elements, and what remains is profit. Böhm-Bawerk
wittily remarks that the saying that wages are determined by the
product of labour apparently only amounts to this—that what
remains (if any) after the other co-operators have had their share
is wages. Each co-partner in turn becomes a residual claimant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
and the amount of the residuum is determined by assuming that
we already know the share of the other claimants!<a name="FNanchor_1106" id="FNanchor_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p>The new school refuses any longer to pay honour to this ancient
trinity. It is impossible to treat each factor separately because of
the intimate connection between them, and their productive work,
as the Hedonists point out, must necessarily be complementary.
In any case, before we can determine the relative shares of each
we must be certain that our unknown <i>x</i> is not reckoned among
the known. This naturally leads them on to the realm of mathematical
formulæ and equations.</p>

<p>All the Hedonists, however, do not employ mathematics. The
Psychological school, especially the Austrian section of it, seems to
think that little can be gained by the employment of mathematical
formulæ. Some of the Mathematical economists, on the other hand,
are equally convinced of the futility of psychology, especially of
the famous principle of final utility, which is the corner-stone of
the Austrian theory.<a name="FNanchor_1107" id="FNanchor_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

<p>For the sake of clearness it may be better to take the two branches—the
Psychological and the Mathematical—separately.</p>

<h4 id="heading70">II: THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCHOOL</h4>

<p>The feature of the Psychological school is its fidelity to the doctrine
of final utility, whatever that may mean.<a name="FNanchor_1108" id="FNanchor_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> The older economists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
had got hold of a similar notion when they spoke of value in use,
but instead of preserving the idea they dismissed it with a name,
and it was left to the Psychological school to revive it in its present
glorified form.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the term is employed in the usual
popular sense of something beneficial. All that it connotes is
ability to satisfy some human want, be that want reasonable,
ridiculous, or reprobatory. Bread, diamonds, and opium are all
equally useful in this sense.<a name="FNanchor_1109" id="FNanchor_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a></p>

<p>Nor must we fall into the opposite error of thinking of it as
the utility of things in general. Rather is it the utility of a particular
unit of some specific commodity relative to the demand of
some individual for that commodity, whether the individual in
question be producer or consumer. It is not a question of bread
in general, but of the number of loaves. To speak of the utility of
bread in general is absurd, and, moreover, there is no means of
measuring it. What is interesting to me is the amount of bread
which I want. This simple change in the general point of view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
has effectively got rid of all the ambiguities under which the Classical
school laboured.<a name="FNanchor_1110" id="FNanchor_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a></p>

<p>1. The first problem that suggests itself in this connection is
this: Why is the idea of value inseparable from that of scarcity?
Simply because the utility of each unit depends upon the intensity
of the immediate need that requires satisfaction, and this intensity
itself depends upon the quantity already possessed, for it is a law
of physiology as well as of psychology that every need is limited
by nature and grows less as the amount possessed increases, until
a point zero is reached. This point is called the point of satiety,
and beyond it the degree of utility becomes negative and desire is
transformed into repulsion.<a name="FNanchor_1111" id="FNanchor_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> Hence the first condition of utility
is limitation of supply.</p>

<p>So long as people held to the idea of utility in general it was
impossible to discover any necessary connection between utility
and scarcity. It was easy enough to see that an explanation that
was not based upon one or other of these two ideas was bound to
be unsatisfactory, but nobody knew why. As soon as the connection
between the two was realised, however, it became evident that
utility must be regarded as a function of the quantity possessed,
and that this degree of utility constitutes what we call value.</p>

<p>2. Just as the notion of final utility solved one of the most
difficult problems in economics, namely, why water, for example,
has less value than diamonds, it also helped to clear up another
mystery that had perplexed many economists from the Physiocrats
downward, namely, how exchange, which by definition implies the
equivalence of the objects exchanged, can result in a gain for both
parties. Here at last is the enigma solved. In an act of exchange
attention must be focused not upon the total but upon the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
utility. The equality in the case of both parties lies in the balance
between the last portion that is acquired and the last portion that
is given up.</p>

<p>Imagine two Congoese merchants, the one, A, having a heap
of salt, and the other, B, a heap of rice, which they are anxious to
exchange. As yet the rate of exchange is undetermined, but let
them begin. A takes a handful of salt and passes it on to B, who
does the same with the rice, and so the process goes on. A casts
his eye upon the two heaps as they begin mounting up, and as the
heap of rice keeps growing the utility of each new handful that is
added keeps diminishing, because he will soon have enough to
supply all his wants. It is otherwise with the salt, each successive
handful assuming an increasing utility. Now, seeing that the utility
of the one keeps increasing, while that of the other decreases,
there must come a time when they will both be equal. At that
point A will stop. The rate of exchange will be determined, and
the prices fixed by the relative measures of the two heaps. At that
moment the heap of rice acquired will not have for A a much greater
utility than has the heap of salt with which he has parted.</p>

<p>But A is not the only individual concerned, and it is not at all
probable that B will feel inclined to stop at the same moment as A;
and if he had made up his mind to stop before A had been satisfied
with the quantity of rice given him no exchange would have been
possible. We must suppose, then, that each party to the exchange
must be ready to go to some point beyond the limit which the other
has fixed <i>in petto</i>. This point can only be arrived at by bargaining.<a name="FNanchor_1112" id="FNanchor_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Another question that requires answering is this: How is it
that there is only one price for goods of the same quality in the
same market? Once it is clearly grasped that the utility spoken
of is the utility of each separate unit for each separate individual
it will be realised that there must be as many different utilities as
there are units, for each of them satisfies a different need. But
if this is the case, why does a person who is famishing not pay a
much higher price for a loaf than a wealthy person who has very
little need for it? or, why do I not pay more when I am hungry than
when I am not? The reason is that it would be absurd to imagine
that goods which are nearly identical and even interchangeable
should have different exchange values on the same market and
especially for the same person. This law of indifference,<a name="FNanchor_1113" id="FNanchor_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> as it is
called, is derived from another law to which the Psychological
school rightly attaches great importance, and which constitutes
one of its most precious contributions to the study of economics,
namely, the law of substitution. This law implies that whenever
one commodity can be exchanged for another for the purpose of
satisfying the same need, the commodity replaced cannot be much
more valuable than the commodity replacing it.<a name="FNanchor_1114" id="FNanchor_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a></p>

<p>For what is substitution but mutual exchange? And exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
implies equality, so that if there is a series of interchangeable goods
none of them can be of greater value than any of the rest.</p>

<p>Consequently, if an individual has at his disposal 100 glasses
of water, which is easily available everywhere except in the Sahara,
perhaps, no one of these glasses, not even that one for which he
would be willing to give its weight in gold were he very thirsty and
that the only glassful available, will have a greater value than has
the hundredth, which is worth exactly nothing. The hundredth is
always there ready to be substituted for any of the others.</p>

<p>But the best way of getting a clear idea of final utility is not
to consider the value of the object A, but of the object B, which
can replace it. It becomes evident, then, that if I am about to lose
some object, A, which I value a good deal but which can be perfectly
replaced by another object, B, that object A cannot be much
more valuable than B; and if I had the further choice of replacing
it by C, C being less valuable than B, then A itself cannot be much
more valuable than C.<a name="FNanchor_1115" id="FNanchor_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a></p>

<p>We arrive, then, at this conclusion: The value of wealth of every
kind is determined by the value of its least useful portion—that is,
by the least satisfaction which any one portion of it can give.</p>

<p class="tb">Hitherto we have been concerned with the notion of final utility
as applied to the problems of value and exchange, but has it the
same effect when applied to problems of production, distribution,
or consumption? The Hedonists have no doubt as to the answer,
for what are production, distribution, and consumption but
modifications of exchange?</p>

<p>Take production, for example. How is it that under a system of
free competition the value of the product is regulated by its cost
of production? It is because a competitive <i>régime</i> is by every
definition a <i>régime</i> where at any moment one product may be
exchanged for another of a similar character, the similarity in this
case being simply the result of a certain transformation of the raw
material. The law of substitution is operative here, and the reason
why cost of production regulates value is that the cost of production
at any moment represents the last interchangeable value.</p>

<p>The same is true of consumption, as we can see if we only watch
the way in which each of us distributes his purchases and arranges
his expenditure. There is evident everywhere an attempt to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
the best out of life—to get all the enjoyment which our different
incomes may be made to yield; here spending more on house-room
and less on food, there curtailing on amusement and extending on
charity, until a rough kind of equilibrium is reached where the final
utility of the last exchanged objects—or, if another phrase be
preferred, the intensities of the last satisfied needs—are equal. If
the coin spent in purchasing the last cigar does not yield the same
pleasure as the same coin yields when spent on a newspaper, the
newspaper will in future probably take the place of the cigar.
Consumption seems really to be a kind of exchange, with conscience
for mart and desires as buyers and sellers.<a name="FNanchor_1116" id="FNanchor_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a></p>

<p>Nor is the realm of distribution even beyond the reach of the
utility theory. Its application to the problems of interest, wages,
and rent is largely the work of American economists, especially of
J.B. Clark. It is quite impossible for us to give an exposition of
the subtle analyses in which the quarterly reviews of the American
universities take such a delight, and which undoubtedly afford a
very welcome relaxation in an atmosphere so charged with pragmatism
and realism. But we must just glance at the theory of
wages. Wages, like other values, must be determined by final
utility. But the final utility of what, and for whom? The final
utility of the services which the worker renders to the <i>entrepreneur</i>.
Following other factors of production, the final productivity of the
workers will determine their wages. That is, their final utility
is fixed by the value produced by the marginal worker—no matter
how worthless he may be—who only just pays the <i>entrepreneur</i>.
The value produced by this almost supernumerary worker not only
fixes the maximum which the employer can afford to give him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
but also the wages given to all the other workers who can take his
place, <i>i.e.</i> who are employed upon the same kind of work as his,
although they may produce much more than he does; just as in the
case of the 100 glasses of water the least valuable glassful determines
the value of all the rest.<a name="FNanchor_1117" id="FNanchor_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a></p>

<p>Thus is the productivity theory of wages at once confirmed and
corrected. But this time it is the productivity of the least productive
worker, of the individual who barely keeps himself. No
wonder the theory has lost its optimistic note. Somehow or other
it does not seem very different from the old “brazen law.”</p>

<p>The rate of interest follows a similar line—the marginal item of
capital fixing the rate. It is even more true of capital, which is
more completely standardised, with the result that the principle of
substitution works much more easily.<a name="FNanchor_1118" id="FNanchor_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a></p>

<p>Rent is treated at greater length in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Gradually we begin to realise how the observation of certain facts
apparently of a worthless or insignificant character, such as the
substitution of chicory for coffee or the complete uselessness of a
single glove, enabled the Psychological school to propound a number
of general theories such as the law of substitution and the doctrine
of complementary goods which shed new light upon a great number
of economic questions. There is something very impressive about
this deductive process that irresistibly reminds one of the genie of
the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>, who grew gradually bigger and
bigger until he finally reached the heavens. But then the genie
was nothing but flame. It still remains to be seen whether this is
equally true of the Hedonistic theories.</p>

<h4 id="heading71">III: THE MATHEMATICAL SCHOOL<a name="FNanchor_1119" id="FNanchor_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a></h4>

<p>The Mathematical school is distinguished for its attachment to
the study of exchange, from which it proposes to deduce the whole
of political economy. Its method is based upon the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
every exchange may be represented as an equation, A = B, which
expresses the relation between the quantities exchanged. Thus the
first step plunges us into mathematics.</p>

<p>However true this may be, the application of the method must
necessarily be very limited if it is always to be confined to exchange.
It is, however, a mistake to suppose that this is really the case, and
one of the most ingenious and fruitful contributions made by the new
school was to show how this circle could be gradually enlarged so as
to include the whole of economic science.</p>

<p>Distribution, production, and even consumption are included
within its ambit. Let us take distribution first and inquire what
wages and rent are. In a word, what are revenues? A revenue is
the price of certain services rendered by labour, capital, and land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
the agents of production, and paid for by the <i>entrepreneur</i> as the
result of an act of exchange.</p>

<p>And what is production? It is but the exchanging of one
utility for another—a certain quantity of raw materials and of
labour for a certain quantity of consumable goods. Even nature
might be compared to a merchant exchanging products for labour,
and Xenophon must have had a glimpse of this ingenious theory
when he declared that “the gods sell us goods in return for our
toil.” The analogy might be pushed still farther, and every act of
exchange may be considered an act of production. Pantaleoni puts
it elegantly when he says that “a partner to an exchange is
very much like a field that needs tilling or a mine that requires
exploiting.”<a name="FNanchor_1120" id="FNanchor_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a></p>

<p>And what are capitalisation, investment, and loan but the
exchange of present goods and immediate joys for the goods and
enjoyments of the future?</p>

<p>It was a comparison instituted between the lending of money
and an ordinary act of exchange that led Böhm-Bawerk to formulate
his celebrated theory of interest. Böhm-Bawerk, however, is a representative
of the Austrian rather than the Mathematical school.</p>

<p>Even consumption—that is, the employment of wealth—implies
incessant exchanging, for if our resources are necessarily limited
that must involve a choice between the object which we buy and
that which with a sigh we are obliged to renounce. To give up an
evening at the theatre in order to buy a book is to exchange one
pleasure for another, and the law of exchange covers this case just
as well as any other.<a name="FNanchor_1121" id="FNanchor_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> It is the same everywhere. To pay taxes is to
give up a portion of our goods in order to obtain security for all
the rest. The rearing of children involves the sacrifice of one’s own
well-being and comfort in exchange for the joys of family life and
the good opinion of our fellow-men.</p>

<p>It is not impossible, then, to discover among economic facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
certain relations which are expressible in algebraical formulæ or
even reducible to figures. The art of the Mathematical economist
consists in the discovery of such relations and in putting them forth
in the form of equations.</p>

<p>For example, we know that when the price of a commodity goes
up the demand for it falls off. Here are two quantities, one of
which is a function of the other.<a name="FNanchor_1122" id="FNanchor_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> Let us see how the law of demand
in its amended form would express this.</p>

<p>If along a horizontal line A B we take a number of fixed points
equidistant from one another to represent prices, <i>e.g.</i> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 … 10,
and from each of these points we draw a vertical line to represent
the quantity demanded at that price, and then join the summits of
these vertical lines, which are known as the ordinates, we have a
curve starting at a fairly high point—representing the lowest prices—and
gradually descending as the prices rise until it becomes
merged with the horizontal, at which point the demand becomes <i>nil</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1123" id="FNanchor_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a></p>

<p>What is very interesting is that the curve is different for different
products. In some cases the curve is gentle, in others abrupt,
according as the demand, as Marshall puts it, has a greater or lesser
degree of elasticity. Every commodity has, so to speak, its own
characteristic curve, enabling us, at least theoretically, to recognise
that product among a hundred.<a name="FNanchor_1124" id="FNanchor_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></p>

<p>Geometrical figures can always take the place of equations, for every
equation can be expressed in the form of a curve. Geometrical representation
makes a quicker appeal to the eye, and it is extremely useful where people
are not conversant with the calculus which is frequently employed by Cournot
and other Mathematical writers. But it is hardly as fruitful, for a geometrical
figure can only trace the relation between two quantities, one of which is
fixed and the other is variable, or between three at most, when two would be
variable. Even in this case recourse would be necessary to projections, and the
figures in that case would not be very clear. In the case of algebraical formulæ,
on the other hand, we can have as much variation as we like provided we have as
many equations as there are variables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<p>We would naturally expect the supply curve to be just the
inverse of the demand curve, rising with a rising price and descending
with a falling one, so that by the time the price is zero supply is <i>nil</i>,
whereas the demand is infinite.<a name="FNanchor_1125" id="FNanchor_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is not quite correct to regard it as merely the inverse of
the demand curve. A supply curve is really a much more
complicated affair, because supply itself depends upon cost of
production, and there are some kinds of production—agriculture,
for example—where the cost of production increases much more
rapidly than the quantity produced. In industry, on the other
hand, the cost of production decreases as the quantity produced
increases.</p>

<p>Mathematical political economy, not content with seeking
relations of mutual dependence between isolated facts, claims to be
able to embrace the whole field within its comprehensive formulæ.
Everything seems to be in a state of equilibrium, and any attempt
to upset it is immediately corrected by a tendency to re-establish it.<a name="FNanchor_1126" id="FNanchor_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>
To determine the conditions of equilibrium is the one object of
pure economics.</p>

<p>The most remarkable attempt at systematisation of this kind
was made by Professor Walras, who endeavoured to bring every
aspect of the economic world within his formula, a task almost
as formidable as that attempted by Laplace in his <i>Mécanique
céleste</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1127" id="FNanchor_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></p>

<p>Let us imagine the whole of society included within one single
room, say the London Stock Exchange, which is full of the tumult
of those who have come to buy and sell, and who keep shouting
their prices. In the centre, occupying the place usually taken up
by the market, sits the <i>entrepreneur</i>, a merchant or manufacturer
or an agriculturist, as the case may be, who performs a double
function.</p>

<p>On the one hand he buys from producers, whether rural or urban,
landlords, capitalists, or workers, what Walras calls their “productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
services,” that is, the fertility of their lands, the productivity of their
capital or their labour force, and by paying them the price fixed by
the laws of exchange he determines the revenue of each; to the
proprietor he pays a rent, to the capitalist interest, to the workman
wages. But how is that price determined? Just as at the Exchange
all values whatsoever are determined by the law of demand and
supply, so the <i>entrepreneur</i> demands so many services at such and
such a price and the capitalist or workman offers him so many at
that price, and the price will rise or fall until the quantity of services
offered is equal to the quantity demanded.</p>

<p>The <i>entrepreneur</i> on his side disposes of the manufactured goods
fashioned in his factory or the agricultural products grown on his
farm to those very same persons, who have merely changed their
clothes and become consumers. As a matter of fact the proprietors,
capitalists, and workers who formerly figured as the vendors of
services now reappear as the buyers of goods. And who else did we
expect the buyers to be? Who else could they be?</p>

<p>And in this market the prices of products are determined in just
the same fashion as we have outlined above.</p>

<p>All at once, however, a newer and a grander aspect of the
equilibrium comes to view. Is it not quite evident that the total
value of the productive services on the one hand and the total value
of the products on the other must be mathematically equal? The
<i>entrepreneur</i> cannot possibly receive in payment for the goods
which he has sold to the consumers more than he gave to the same
persons, who were just now producers, in return for their services.
For where could they possibly get more money? It is a closed
circuit, the quantity that comes out through one outlet re-enters
through another.</p>

<p>With the important difference that it keeps much closer to facts,
the explanation bears a striking resemblance to Quesnay’s <i>Tableau
économique</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1128" id="FNanchor_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>We have two markets in juxtaposition,<a name="FNanchor_1129" id="FNanchor_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> the one for services and
the other for products, and in each of them prices are determined by
the same laws, which are three in number:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) On the same market there can be only one price for the same
class of goods.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This price must be such that the quantity offered and the
quantity demanded shall exactly coincide.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The price must be such as will give maximum satisfaction to
the maximum number of buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>All these laws are mathematical in character and involve problems
of equilibrium.</p>

<p>In some such way would the new school reduce the science of
economics to a sort of mechanism of exchange, basing its justification
upon the contention that the Hedonistic principle of obtaining
the maximum of satisfaction at the minimum discomfort is a purely
mechanical principle, which in other connections is known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
principle of least resistance or the law of conservation of energy.
Every individual is regarded simply as the slave of self-interest, just as
the billiard-ball is of the cue. It is the delight of every economist
as of every good billiard-player to study the complicated figures
which result from the collision of the balls with one another or with
the cushion.<a name="FNanchor_1130" id="FNanchor_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p>

<p>Another problem of equilibrium is to discover the exact proportion
in which the different elements combine in production. Jevons
compares production to the infernal mixture which was boiled in
their cauldron by the witches in <i>Macbeth</i>. But the ingredients are
not mixed haphazard, and Pareto thinks that they conform to a law
analogous to the law known in chemistry as the law of definite
proportions, which determines that molecules shall combine in certain
proportions only. The combination of the productive factors is
perhaps not quite so rigidly fixed as is the proportion of hydrogen
and oxygen which goes to form water. Similar results, for example,
may be obtained by employing more hand labour and less capital, or
more capital and less hand labour. But there must be some certain
proportion which will yield a maximum utility, and this maximum
is obtainable in precisely the same way as in other cases of equilibrium—that
is, by varying the “doses” of capital and labour until the final
utility in the case both of capital and labour becomes equal. Generally
speaking, this is the law that puts a limit to the indefinite expansion
of industry, for whenever one element runs short, be it land or
capital, labour or managing ability or markets, all the others are
directly affected adversely and the undertaking as a whole becomes
more difficult and less effective. Pareto rightly enough attaches the
greatest importance to this law, and we have only to remember that
it is the direct antithesis of the famous law of accumulation of
capital to realise its full significance.</p>

<p>There are several other cases of interdependence to which the
new school has drawn attention, as, for example, that of certain
complementary goods whose values cannot vary independently.
What is the use of one glove or one stocking without another, of
a motor-car without petrol, of a table service without glasses?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
Not only is this true of consumption goods; it also applies to
production goods. The value of coke is necessarily connected with
the value of gas, for you cannot produce the one without the other,
and this applies to all by-products. The possibility of utilising a
by-product always lowers the price of the main commodity.</p>

<h4 id="heading72">IV: CRITICISM OF THE HEDONISTIC DOCTRINES</h4>

<p>The triumph of the new doctrines has been by no means universal.
England, Italy, and Germany, and even the United States, where
one would least expect enthusiasm for abstract speculation, have
supplied many disciples, and several professorial chairs and learned
reviews have been placed at their disposal. But up to the present
France seems altogether closed to them. Not only was Walras,
the <i>doyen</i> of the new school, forced to leave France to find in foreign
lands a more congenial environment for the promulgation of his ideas,
but until recently it would have been quite impossible to mention a
single book or a single course of lectures given either in a university or
anywhere else in which these doctrines were taught or even criticised.<a name="FNanchor_1131" id="FNanchor_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a></p>

<p>We might have understood this antipathy more easily if France,
like Germany, had already been annexed by the Historical school.
There would have been some truth in a theory of incompatibility
of tempers under circumstances of that kind. But the great
majority of French economists were still faithful to the Liberal
tradition, and one might naturally have expected a hearty welcome
for a school that is essentially Neo-Classical and pretends
nothing more than to give a fuller demonstration of the theories
already taught by the old masters.<a name="FNanchor_1132" id="FNanchor_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>The mere fact, however, that they presumed to draw fresh lessons
or to deduce new principles from those already formulated by the
older writers appeared an unwarranted interference with doctrines
that had hitherto seemed good enough for everyone. Criticism of
that kind, of course, is not worth serious attention.</p>

<p>An easier line of criticism, and one very frequently adopted,
is to maintain that the wants and desires of mankind are incapable
of measurement and that mathematical causations can never be
reconciled with the doctrine of free will. But such claims as
these were never put forward by the Mathematical school. On
the contrary, it has always recognised that every man is free to
follow his own bent—<i>trahit sua quemque voluptas</i>—merely inquiring
how man is to act if he is to obtain the maximum satisfaction
out of the means at his disposal and to overcome the obstacles
that stand in his way. Neither has it ever ventured to say that
such and such a man is forced to sell corn or to buy it, but simply
that if he does buy or sell it will be with a determination to make
the best of the bargain, and that such being the case the buying or
selling will take place in such and such a fashion. It further claims
that the action of a number of individuals under similar circumstances
is equally calculable. So is the movement of the balls on the
billiard-table, but that does not interfere with the liberty of the
players.<a name="FNanchor_1133" id="FNanchor_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a></p>

<p>Nor do they pretend to be able to measure our desires. What
they do—and it is not so absurd after all, because we are all doing
it—is to express in pounds, shillings, and pence the value we put
upon the acquisition or loss of an object that satisfies our desire.
Moreover, the Mathematical school does not make much use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
numbers, but confines itself to algebraical notation and geometrical
figures—that is, to the consideration of abstract quantities. To
write down a problem in the form of a mathematical equation is
to show that the problem can be solved and to give the conditions
under which solution is alone possible. Beyond this the economist
never goes. He never tries to fix the price of corn, whatever it may
be; he leaves that to the speculators.<a name="FNanchor_1134" id="FNanchor_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<p>From the other side—that is, from the historians, interventionists,
solidarists, socialists—comes criticism which is quite as bitter and
not a whit easier to justify. The Hedonistic doctrine appears to
them simply as a fresh attempt to restore the optimistic teaching
of the Manchester school, with its individualism and egoism, its
free competition and general harmony, its insidious justification of
interest, rent, and starvation wages—in the name of some imaginary
entity which they call marginal utility. In short, it looks just like
another proof of the thesis that the present economic order is the best
possible—a proof that is all the less welcome seeing that it claims
to be scientific and mathematically infallible.</p>

<p>This sort of criticism is nothing less than caricature. It would
be futile to deny that the new school has undertaken the task of
carrying on the work of the Classical writers, but what possible
harm can there be in that? The royal road of science often turns
out to be nothing better than a very narrow path—but it does
lead somewhere. There would be no progress in economic science
or in any other if every generation were to throw overboard all
the work done by its predecessors. What the Hedonistic school
has tried to do is to distinguish between the good and the bad
work of the Classical writers and to retain the one while rejecting
the other.</p>

<p>The main object of the equilibrium and final utility theories is
not to justify the present economic <i>régime</i>, but merely to explain it,<a name="FNanchor_1135" id="FNanchor_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a>
which is quite a different matter. But it does happen in this case
that the explanation justifies the conclusion that under the conditions
of a free market the greatest good of the greatest number would naturally
be secured. The term “good,” however, is used in a purely
Hedonistic and not in the ethical sense. No attention is paid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
the pre-existing conditions of the exchange, and none is bestowed
upon its possible consequences. The old-time bargain between
Esau and Jacob, when the former sold his birthright for a mere
mess of pottage, gave the maximum of satisfaction to both, even
to Esau, of whom it is related that he was at the point of death,
and to whom accordingly the pottage must have been of infinite
value. Even if Jacob had offered him a bottle of absinthe instead
the result would have been equally satisfactory from a Hedonistic
standpoint. The theory takes as little account of hygiene as it
does of morals.</p>

<p>The Hedonist, by way of amendment, might suggest that Esau
would have made a better bargain if there had been, not one, but
several Jacobs offering the pottage, which helps to explain why
they are so partial to competition and so strongly opposed to
monopoly.<a name="FNanchor_1136" id="FNanchor_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> No Hedonist would deny that Esau was exploited by
Jacob; but, on the other hand, they would point out that there is
no necessity to imagine that society is made up only of Esaus and
Jacobs.<a name="FNanchor_1137" id="FNanchor_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>The same thing applies to Böhm-Bawerk’s celebrated theory
of interest. Indeed, Böhm-Bawerk quite definitely states that he
merely wants to discover some explanation of interest, but does not
anticipate that he will be able to justify it, and in that spirit he
condemns the ethical justifications that were attempted some
centuries back. His object is to show that interest is neither due
to the productivity of capital nor to the differential advantages
enjoyed by its possessor. Neither is it a tax levied upon the
exploited borrower: it is simply a <i>time</i>-payment. In other words,
it represents the difference between the value of a present good
and the same good on some future occasion. It is just the result
of exchanging a present good for a future one. A hundred francs
a year hence are not equal in value to a hundred francs here and
now. To make them equal we must either add something by way
of interest to the future item or take away something by way of
discount from the present one.<a name="FNanchor_1138" id="FNanchor_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to the theory of wages, according to which the wages
of each class of producers is supposed to be determined by the
productivity of the marginal worker in that class, we are struck by
the fact that it is only a little less pessimistic than the old “brazen
law.” What it really implies is that the marginal worker—the
worker whom the <i>entrepreneur</i> is only just induced to employ—consumes
all that he produces.</p>

<p>The Hedonistic school, in short, has no theory of distribution,
neither does it seem very anxious to have one. It speaks, not of
co-sharers, but of productive services, whose relative contributions
it is interested to discover. But it is one thing to know exactly
what fraction of the work is due to a certain unit of capital or a
given individual workman, and quite another to know whether
workers or capitalists are being unfairly treated.</p>

<p>The best proof that the Hedonists are not mere advocates of
<i>laissez-faire</i> is the general attitude of the leaders. It is true that
the Austrian school has always shown itself quite indifferent to the
social or working-class question,<a name="FNanchor_1139" id="FNanchor_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> as it is sometimes called, but it
certainly has a perfect right to confine itself to pure economics
if it wishes. The other leaders of the school, however, have clearly
shown that the method followed need involve no such approval or
acquiescence. Not to mention Stanley Jevons, who in his book
<i>Social Reform</i> makes a very strong case for intervention, we
have also Professor Walras, who stands in the front rank of agrarian
socialists. Leaving aside merely utilitarian considerations, he
points out that in the interest of justice, which, as he has been
careful to emphasise, involves quite a different point of view, he
wants to establish a <i>régime</i> of absolutely free competition. But
how is this to be accomplished? Merely by means of <i>laissez-faire</i>,
as the old Liberal school had thought? Not at all. It can only
be done through the abolition of monopoly of every kind, and land
monopoly, which is the foundation of every other, must go first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
The reform advocated in his <i>Économie sociale</i> consists of two
items, land nationalisation and the abolition of all taxation. The
two items are intimately connected because the rents now become
the possession of the State will take the place of the taxes, and the
object of both is the same, namely, the extension of free competition
by securing to every citizen the full produce of his work. Under
existing conditions the producer is doubly taxed—in the first place
by the landowner and then by the State.<a name="FNanchor_1140" id="FNanchor_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> Moreover, when we
remember that the point of equilibrium in Walras’s system occurs
just where the selling price exactly coincides with the cost of production—in
other words, where profit is reduced to zero—we begin
to realise how far it is from anything in the nature of an apology
for the present condition of things.</p>

<p>Vilfredo Pareto, another representative of this school, although
ultra-individualistic in his opinions and extremely hostile to interventionism
or solidarity, takes good care not to connect his personal
opinion with the Hedonistic doctrines. As a matter of fact he
thinks that, theoretically at least, the maximum of well-being might
be equally attainable under a collectivist <i>régime</i>, although he does
not think that collectivism is yet possible. But this opinion is
founded upon “ethical and other considerations which are quite
outside the scope of economics.”<a name="FNanchor_1141" id="FNanchor_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a></p>

<p>M. Pantaleoni, who soars higher still into the realm of pure,
transcendental science, ventures to declare that the substitution
of purely altruistic motives for merely selfish ones would involve
about as much change in the calculation as would the substitution
throughout of a plus for a minus sign in an algebraical equation.
All extremes meet. Complete disinterestedness and absolute egoism
would necessarily work out very much the same. Devotion to
duty would replace the clamour for rights; sacrifices would be
exchanged instead of utilities. But the laws determining their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
exchange would still be the same. The Hedonists are not so much
concerned with the morality of such laws as with the productive
capacity of a given economic state, just as in the case of a piece of
machinery the engineer’s sole concern is to gauge the output of that
machine.</p>

<p>But the most serious criticism passed upon the work of the
school is that at the end of the reckoning nothing has been discovered
that was not already known, to which the Hedonists reply that they
have at least succeeded in making certain what was only tentative
before. The discovery of truth appears to be an intermittent
process, and the first vague presentiment is often as useful as the
so-called scientific discovery. Astronomy, which is the most perfect
of the sciences, has progressed just in this way. The older economists
felt fully convinced that the <i>régime</i> of free competition was best, but
they gave no reason for the faith that was in them and no demonstration
of the conditions under which the doctrine was true. Such a
demonstration the Mathematical economists claim to have given by
showing that a <i>régime</i> of free competition is the only one where a
maximum of satisfaction is available at a minimum of sacrifice for
both parties. The same consideration applies to the law of demand
and supply, the law of indifference, cost of production, wages,
interest, rent, etc. To have given an irrefutable demonstration of
theories that were formerly little better than vague intuitions<a name="FNanchor_1142" id="FNanchor_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> or
amorphous hypotheses is certainly something. We may laugh as
much as we like at the <i>homo œconomicus</i>, who is by this time little
better than a skeleton, but it is the skeleton that has helped the
science to stand upright and make progress. It has helped forward
the process from the invertebrate to the vertebrate.</p>

<p>But admitting that all these doctrines have been definitely
proved, as the Hedonists claim they have, is the science going to
profit as much as they thought by it? Somebody has remarked
that mathematics is a mere mill that grinds whatever is brought to
it. The important question is, What is the corn like? In this case
it consists of a mass of abstractions—a number of individuals
actuated by the same selfish motives, alike in what they desire to
get and are willing to give,<a name="FNanchor_1143" id="FNanchor_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> the assumed ubiquity of capital and
labour, facility for substitution, etc. It is possible enough that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
flour coming from the mill may not prove very nutritious. When
ground out the result would at any rate be as unlike reality as the
new society outlined by Fourier, the Saint-Simonians, or the
anarchists, and its realisation quite as improbable, unless we presuppose
an equally miraculous revolution. The Hedonists frankly
recognise this, and in this respect they show themselves superior to
the Classical economists, who when they talk of free competition
believe that it actually exists.<a name="FNanchor_1144" id="FNanchor_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a></p>

<p>But however sceptical they are about the possibility of ever
realising all this, they are somewhat emphatic about the virtues of
the new method, and they are not exempt, perhaps, from a certain
measure of dogmatic pride which irresistibly reminds one of the
Utopian socialists. Could we not, for example, imagine Fourier
writing in this strain: “What has already been accomplished is
as nothing compared with what may be discovered” (by the application
of the mathematical method);<a name="FNanchor_1145" id="FNanchor_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> or “The new theories concerning
cost of production have the same fundamental importance in
political economy that the substitution of the Copernican for the
Ptolemaic system has in astronomy”?<a name="FNanchor_1146" id="FNanchor_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> We have already called
attention to the comparison of Walras’s system with Newton’s
<i>Principia</i>—all of which rather savours of enthusiasm outrunning
judgment.</p>

<p>While recognising the very real services which the Mathematical
and Austrian schools have rendered to the science, and admitting
that they mark an era in the history of economics which can never be
forgotten, we cannot do better than conclude with the advice of an
economist who is himself an authority both in the Mathematical
and Classical schools, and who is therefore well qualified to judge:
“The most useful applications of mathematics to economics are
those which are short and simple and which employ few symbols;
and which aim at throwing a bright light on some small part of the
great economic movement rather than at representing its endless
complexities.”<a name="FNanchor_1147" id="FNanchor_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II_THE_THEORY_OF_RENT_AND">CHAPTER II: THE THEORY OF RENT AND
ITS APPLICATIONS</h3>

<p>The revival of interest in Classical theories, of which mention was
made in the last chapter, cannot be passed over without a special
reference to the theory of rent. The theory of rent has always
held a prominent place in economic science, especially during the
earlier years of the nineteenth century, and the recent developments
it has undergone are significant equally from a theoretical as from
a practical standpoint.</p>

<p>Theoretically it has been shown that the concept rent, which
for a long time was supposed to be indissolubly bound up with a
particular economic phenomenon, namely, the revenue of landed
proprietors, is capable of several applications and extensions, some
of which might throw considerable light into more than one obscure
corner of the economic world. Particularly does it seem applicable
to a kind of revenue of which we hardly heard mention until recently—that
is, the profits of the <i>entrepreneur</i> as distinct from the interest
of the capitalist.</p>

<p>Practically also it is very important. Rent is “unearned
increment” <i>par excellence</i>. In other words, it is a revenue for
which the receiver has ostensibly done nothing. One can well
imagine what fruitful ground for socialistic theories this must be!
And, as a matter of fact, all systems of land nationalisation or of
socialisation of rent—and they are by no means few in number—trace
descent from the old Ricardian theory.</p>

<p>What we propose to do in this chapter is to examine the doctrine
of rent in its twofold aspect, inquiring in the first place what
developments it has recently undergone as a scientific theory,
and, secondly, how it is proposed to apply this theory with a view
to reforming society. The chief aim in view is, of course, to glean
some knowledge of recent theories, but to do this we shall often
find ourselves obliged to follow the stream backward towards
its source in Mill or Ricardo, for in many cases it is the only way
of appreciating the development of ideas.</p>

<h4 id="heading73">I: THE THEORETICAL EXTENSION OF THE
CONCEPT RENT</h4>

<p>In a former chapter we were led to investigate the utterly futile
attempts made both by Carey and Bastiat to undermine the Ricardian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
theory of rent. Open to criticism the theory certainly is, but in
their anxiety to do away with it altogether these critics were led to
deny that the land had any value at all.</p>

<p>But this denial has been refuted in no equivocal fashion by the
emergence of what is perhaps the most striking phenomenon in
nineteenth-century history, namely, the fabulous prices paid for
land in the neighbourhood of large cities. The last century was
pre-eminently the century of big towns. No other epoch in history
can point to such growth of urban centres. England, America,
Germany, and to a lesser degree France, have all had a share in
this development. One result of this rapid agglomeration of population
in restricted areas has been a wonderful growth of rents, or
unearned increment. A quarter of an acre of land in the city of
Chicago which was bought in 1830 for $20, at a time when the
population was only fifty, and which in 1836 was sold for $25,000,
was valued at $1,250,000 at the time of the International Exhibition
in 1894. It has been calculated that the increase in ground-rents
in London between 1870 and 1895 is represented by no less a sum
than £7,000,000. Hyde Park, bought by the City of London in 1652
for £17,000, is to-day valued at about £8,000,000. M. d’Avenel states
that in Paris a piece of land belonging to the Hôtel Dieu which was
valued at 6 fr. 40 c. a square metre in 1775 is worth 1000 fr. to-day,<a name="FNanchor_1148" id="FNanchor_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>
and M. Leroy-Beaulieu mentions a piece of land in the neighbourhood
of the Arc de Triomphe which between 1881 and 1904, <i>i.e.</i> in twenty-three
years, has doubled its value and is now selling at 800 fr. a
metre as compared with 400 fr. formerly.<a name="FNanchor_1149" id="FNanchor_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> We have merely quoted
a few isolated examples, but they may be regarded as typical.</p>

<p>Carey and Bastiat have not made many converts, evidently.
The majority of economists have either accepted Ricardo’s theory
or, having been induced to examine his position thoroughly, have
been led to develop it, but none of them has denied the reality of
the income derived from land. Hence the very curious twofold
evolution which the theory presents.</p>

<p>On the one hand there has been discovered a whole series of
differential revenues analogous to the rent of land, which, according
to the expression of a great contemporary economist, “is not a
thing by itself, but the leading species of a large genus.”<a name="FNanchor_1150" id="FNanchor_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
other hand (and this second line of development is perhaps more
curious than the first), while Ricardo considered that the rent of
land was an economic anomaly resulting from special circumstances,
such as the unequal fertility of the land or the law of diminishing
returns, modern theorists regard it simply as the normal
result of the regular operation of the laws of value. The rent
of land and similar phenomena seem to fit in with the general
theory of prices, and the theory of rent so laboriously constructed
by the Classical school falls into the background as being comparatively
useless. Despite its prestige throughout the nineteenth
century, in a few more years it will be regarded as a mere historical
curiosity.</p>

<p>This double evolution is the result of simultaneous efforts on
the part of a great number of economists. It is almost impossible
to trace a regular sequence of advances from one to the other, and
we shall content ourselves with a mere mention of the names of
those who have contributed most to it, their actual words being
quoted whenever possible.<a name="FNanchor_1151" id="FNanchor_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the first place, we have a number of differential revenues
which are exactly analogous to the rent of land. Equal quantities,
or, as the English economists prefer to put it, equal doses of capital
and labour applied to different lands yield different revenues: such
was the classic statement of the law of rent. Ricardo attributed
the existence of rent to the presence of particular phenomena appertaining
only to land, such as diminishing returns, unequal fertility,
greater or lesser distance from a market. But it has long been
realised that agriculture is by no means the only domain in which
capital and labour yield unequal returns.</p>

<p>All natural sources of wealth—mines, salt-works, and fisheries—give
rise to exactly similar phenomena. Their productivity is not
identical, their fertility (if the term is permissible) presents the same
differences and their position relative to a market the same variety
as in the case of cultivated lands. Consequently every mine, every
salt-work and fishery that is not on the margin of cultivation yields
a differential revenue or rent because of its greater productivity
or more convenient situation. Ricardo had recognised this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
the case of mines, and Stuart Mill insisted upon its farther
extension.<a name="FNanchor_1152" id="FNanchor_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

<p>Further, land is not employed for tilth only; it is also frequently
used for building purposes. The services which it renders in this
connection are not less important than the others, and between
different sites there are as many distinctions as there are between
the various grades of cultivated lands. Their commercial productivity,
if we may so put it, is by no means uniform. “The ground-rent
of a house in a small village is but a little higher than the rent
of a similar patch of ground in the open fields, but that of a shop
in Cheapside will exceed this by the whole amount at which people
estimate the superior facilities of money-making in the more crowded
place. In this way the value of these sites is governed by the
ordinary principles of rent.”<a name="FNanchor_1153" id="FNanchor_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a></p>

<p>But why even confine attention to land and its uses? Degrees
of productivity and differences of returns are equally evident in
the case of capital. The machinery in one shop may be better, the
organisation more efficient, division of labour more fully developed
than in another because of the relatively greater abundance of
capital, with the result that the production in the one case will
exceed the production in the other, resulting in a supplementary
gain in the case of the first shop.<a name="FNanchor_1154" id="FNanchor_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> Similarly, the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
one worker as compared with another is frequently unequal. One
man without any greater effort may get through more work than
another, and the earnings of that man will exceed those of the other,
so that even a workman may enjoy a supplementary gain of the
nature of a differential rent. And not among workmen only do
aptitudes differ, but also among <i>entrepreneurs</i>. Rent of ability
plays an important <i>rôle</i> in determining the different degrees of
success experienced by different undertakings and the unequal
revenues which they yield. “The extra gains which any producer
or dealer obtains through superior talents for business or superior
business arrangements are very much of a similar kind.” That
is how Mill<a name="FNanchor_1155" id="FNanchor_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> expressed it, content merely to repeat an idea which
Senior had expressed in his <i>Political Economy</i> as early as the year
1836, where he applies the term “rent” to “all peculiar advantages
of extraordinary qualities of body and mind.”<a name="FNanchor_1156" id="FNanchor_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a></p>

<p>The simple suggestion thrown out by Mill and Senior has long
since been developed into a full-blown theory by Francis Walker,
the American economist. The conception of profits as the
remuneration of the <i>entrepreneur’s</i> exceptional skill is examined
in his <i>Treatise on Political Economy</i>, and is further treated in
considerable detail in the <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i> for April
1887.<a name="FNanchor_1157" id="FNanchor_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a></p>

<p>We have already commented upon the optimistic tendencies of
certain American economists. Carey was a case in point; so is
Walker. In a work entitled <i>The Wages Question</i>, published in
1876, Walker made a successful attack upon that most pessimistic
of theories, the wages fund, and forced economists to recognise that
to some extent at any rate the wages depended upon the productivity
of the undertaking. But to show the possibility of wages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
growing with the increased productivity of industry was hardly
enough to satisfy sensitive consciences. Walker was particularly
anxious to foil the socialists by showing that profit is not the outcome
of exploitation, and it was with a view to such demonstration
that the doctrine of rent was so greedily seized upon.</p>

<p>By the term “profit” Walker understands the special remuneration
of the <i>entrepreneur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1158" id="FNanchor_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> omitting any interest which he may draw
as the possessor of capital. This distinguishes him from the majority
of English economists, who, contrary to Continental practice, have
always persisted in confusing the functions of the <i>entrepreneur</i>
and the capitalist. Neither is he content to regard his work as
confined to simple business arrangement and superintendence,
which would result in his being paid a salary equal to that of a
managing director. His work is altogether of a more dignified
character, and consists largely in anticipating the fluctuations of
the market and in organising production to meet them—in a word,
in adapting supply to demand. The <i>entrepreneur</i> is the true
leader of economic progress—a real “captain of industry.”<a name="FNanchor_1159" id="FNanchor_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a></p>

<p>All this implies, says Walker, differences in industrial revenues
exactly analogous to the differences in agricultural incomes. Some
industries yield no profit at all beyond remunerating capital and
labour at the normal rate and leaving enough for the <i>entrepreneur</i>
to prevent his abandoning the undertaking altogether. Other
industries yield a little more, and by imperceptible gradations we
pass from such mediocre undertakings to more prosperous ones, and
finally reach those that yield immense profits. The question then
arises as to whether such abnormal profits in any way represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
wages that have been withheld from the workers. This is not at
all likely, because wages are often highest where profits are greatest.
<i>Cæteris paribus</i>, the probability is that the greater profit in the
one industry as compared with another implies the greater capacity
of the <i>entrepreneur</i> in the one case than in the other. The superior
income is a pure surplus like the rent of land. “Under free and
full competition,” says Walker, “the successful employers of labour
would earn a remuneration which would be exactly measured, in
the case of each man, by the amount of wealth which he could
produce, with a given application of labour and capital, over and
above what would be produced by employers of the lowest industrial,
or no-profits, grade, making use of the same amounts of labour and
capital, just as rent measures the surplus of the produce of the
better lands over and above what would be produced by the same
application of labour and capital to the least productive lands
which contribute to the supply of the market, lands which themselves
bear no rent.”<a name="FNanchor_1160" id="FNanchor_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a></p>

<p>Walker’s theory contains a good deal of truth, although it is
not, perhaps, quite as new as he thought it was. The opinions of
Mill and Senior have already been referred to, and more than one
Continental economist, from J. B. Say to Mangoldt, and including
Hermann,<a name="FNanchor_1161" id="FNanchor_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> have propounded similar views. Nor has the doctrine
ever been completely triumphant in economic circles. Most contemporary
writers, no doubt, regard profit as a kind of rent, due
partly, but only partly, to the personal ability of the <i>entrepreneur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1162" id="FNanchor_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>
Other economists—such as Marshall,<a name="FNanchor_1163" id="FNanchor_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> for example—think that they
can trace some other elements as well, such as insurance against risk
and payment for the necessary expenses of training the <i>entrepreneur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1164" id="FNanchor_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
Walras, on the other hand, omits these last two items and points
out that under static conditions the <i>entrepreneur</i> would neither
gain nor lose. The sole source of profit, then, are those “dynamic”
rents which are the result, so to speak, of the perpetual displacements
of equilibrium in a progressive society. But these dynamic rents
are extremely varied in character and bear no relation to the personal
qualities of the <i>entrepreneur</i>.</p>

<p>Clark<a name="FNanchor_1165" id="FNanchor_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> and others, although subscribing to Walras’s dictum
that profits are really composed of rents, think that there may be
static as well as dynamic rents and that Walras’s hypothesis of
a uniform net cost for all undertakings is altogether too abstract.
Only in the case of the marginal producer, whose expenses are highest,
is there anything like equilibrium between costs and price. The
other producers even when there is no such thing as a temporary
displacement of equilibrium, are able to make substantial incomes
out of the various species of differential rents already mentioned—proximity
to market, better machinery, greater capital, etc. Marshall
speaks of such incomes as composite rent.<a name="FNanchor_1166" id="FNanchor_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a></p>

<p>Walker’s theory has evidently not been accepted without considerable
reservations. And we need only remind ourselves of
the way in which dividends are usually distributed among shareholders
to realise the inadequacy of his conception of rent and the
exaggerated nature of his attempted justification. Would anyone
suggest, for example, that such dividends are merely the result of
exceptional ability?<a name="FNanchor_1167" id="FNanchor_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a></p>

<p>This attempted explanation of profit affords, perhaps, the most
interesting illustration of the extension of the concept rent, although
it is by no means the only one. The Ricardian theory, worked out
to its logical conclusion, reveals the interesting fact that there are
as many kinds of rents as there are different situations in the
economic world. Whenever it becomes necessary to unravel the
mystery surrounding individual inequalities of income recourse is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
had to a generalised theory of rent. “All advantages, in fact,
which one competitor has over another, whether natural or acquired,<a name="FNanchor_1168" id="FNanchor_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>
whether personal or the result of social arrangements … assimilate
the possessor of the advantage to a receiver of rent.”<a name="FNanchor_1169" id="FNanchor_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> Something
of the variety of concrete life is thus reintroduced into the Classical
theory of distribution, although all this was at first rigidly excluded
by the doctrine of equality of interest and uniformity of wages.<a name="FNanchor_1170" id="FNanchor_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>
The theory of rent is an indispensable complement of the Classical
theory of distribution, giving the whole thing a much more realistic
aspect. It is, as it were, the keystone of the whole structure.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) But the theory has also undergone another species of transformation.
Ricardo conceived of rent as essentially a differential
revenue arising out of the differences in the fertility of soils.<a name="FNanchor_1171" id="FNanchor_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> Were
all lands equally fertile there would be no rent. The same remark
applies to the various species of rent discovered since then. There
is always some inherent difference which explains the emergence
of rent, such as the greater suitability of a building site, the greater
vigour of the worker, or the superior intelligence of the <i>entrepreneur</i>.
They are all of a type. <i>Entrepreneurs</i> who produce the same article,
workmen toiling at the same trade, capitals employed in the same
kind of undertaking, may be grouped in an order of diminishing
productivity, much as Ricardo grouped the various species of lands.
The last <i>entrepreneur</i> of the series, the last worker, or the last item
of capital each earns just enough to keep them at that kind of
employment. All the others produce more, and, seeing that they
all sell their goods or services at the same price, they draw a rent
which is greater than the income enjoyed by the others by the
difference between their productivity and that of the last of the
series. The whole economic world seems to be under the dominion of a
kind of law of unequal fertility, not of lands merely, but of capital
and individual capacity as well—a law which is sufficiently general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
in its application to explain all inequalities in the revenues of the
different factors of production.</p>

<p>We cannot help feeling the artificiality of this conception and
wondering whether the differences in revenues are not capable of
explanation upon the basis of a simpler and more general principle.
Is it impossible to take account of them directly and to treat them
as something other than an exception or an anomaly? One cannot
avoid asking such questions, and the reply is not far to seek.</p>

<p>Doubts arise as soon as we realise that land may yield rent
apart from any inequality in its fertility. “If the whole land of a
country were required for cultivation, all of it might yield a rent,”
says Stuart Mill.<a name="FNanchor_1172" id="FNanchor_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> Apparently all that is needed is an intense demand
and a supply that is never equal to that demand, so that the price is
permanently above the cost of production.<a name="FNanchor_1173" id="FNanchor_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> In such a case even
the worst land—assuming that all is not of equal fertility—would
yield a rent. Mill was of opinion that this rarely happened in
the case of land, but was by no means uncommon in the case of
mines.<a name="FNanchor_1174" id="FNanchor_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> Obviously, then, rent is not merely the outcome of unequal
fertility, and the cause must be sought elsewhere. Stuart Mill had
obviously foreseen this when he said that “a thing which is limited
in quantity is still a monopolised article.”<a name="FNanchor_1175" id="FNanchor_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>But if such be the explanation of rent on land which is the last
to be put under cultivation, what is the explanation in the case of
better lands? We are not sure that Stuart Mill foresaw this problem.</p>

<p>This is how he explains the emergence of rent on land No. 1.
Production having become insufficient to meet demand, prices go
up; but it is only when they have reached a certain level—a level,
that is to say, sufficiently high to secure a normal return on the
capital and labour employed—that these lands will be brought under
cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_1176" id="FNanchor_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a></p>

<p>The cause of rent in this case is obviously the growth of demand
and not the cultivation of land No. 2, because the cultivation only
took place when the prices had risen.<a name="FNanchor_1177" id="FNanchor_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> Moreover, the effect of this
cultivation will be rather to check than to encourage the growth
of rent by arresting this upward trend of prices through increasing
the quantity of corn on the market. The rent of land No. 1 is
consequently a scarcity rent which results directly from an increased
demand and is independent of the quality of the land. The real
cause of rent on all lands, whether good or bad, is really the same,
namely, the insufficiency of supply to meet demand.</p>

<p>A similar process of reasoning might be applied to the other
differential rents already mentioned, and the conclusion arrived
at is that rent, whatever form it take, is not an anomaly, but a
perfectly normal consequence of the general laws of value. Whenever
any commodity, from whatever cause, acquires scarcity value and
its price exceeds its cost of production, there results a rent for the
seller of that product. Such is the general formula, and therein we
have a law that is quite independent of the law of diminishing
returns and of the unequal fertility of land.<a name="FNanchor_1178" id="FNanchor_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span></p>

<p>But the issue was not decided at a single stroke. English political
economy is so thoroughly impregnated with Ricardian ideas that
it still adheres to the conception of a differential rent. Continental
economists, on the other hand, have always regarded it as a more
or less natural result of the laws of demand and supply. J. B. Say
had long since made the suggestion that the existence of rent is due
to the needs of society and the prices which it can afford to pay
for its corn.<a name="FNanchor_1179" id="FNanchor_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> A German economist of the name of Hermann, a
professor at Munich, in his original and suggestive work, <i>Staatswirtschaftliche
Untersuchungen</i>, published in 1832, claims that the
rent of land is simply a species of the income of fixed capital.
Whereas circulating capital, because of its superior mobility, has
almost always a uniform rate of interest, fixed capital, which has
not that mobility and which cannot be increased with the same
facility, has a revenue which is generally greater than that of circulating
capital. This surplus revenue or rent, instead of being a
mere transitory phenomenon, might easily become permanent
provided the new fixed capital which enters into competition with it
has a lesser degree of productivity. Such precisely is the case with
land.<a name="FNanchor_1180" id="FNanchor_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> A little later another German of the name of Mangoldt
defined rent as a scarcity price which does not benefit all the factors
of production equally, but only those which cannot be readily
increased in amount. And rent appears in the guise of a differential
revenue simply because scarcity is always relative and is frequently
kept in check by substitutes which generally give a smaller margin
of profit.<a name="FNanchor_1181" id="FNanchor_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> Schäffle, in a work partly devoted to the subject of rent,<a name="FNanchor_1182" id="FNanchor_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
published in 1867, insists on the idea that the soil furnishes rent
not because it is a gift of nature, but simply because of its immobility
and the impossibility either of removing it or of increasing its quantity.
Finally, Karl Menger, in his <i>Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre</i>,
published in 1872, in outlining the foundations of the modern doctrine
of value, assimilated the theory of rent to the general theory of
prices by categorically declaring that “the products of land as far
as the nature of their value is concerned afford no exception to the
general rule, which applies to the value of the services of a machine
or a tool, of a house or a factory, or any other economic good.”<a name="FNanchor_1183" id="FNanchor_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a></p>

<p>The only difference, apparently, which recent economists recognise
between rents conceived of in this fashion is their greater or
lesser duration. The rent furnished by a first-class machine will
disappear very readily because new machines can be turned out
to compete with it. But when the rent is due to superior natural
qualities, whether of land or of men, the element of rent will not
be so easily got rid of. To borrow a phrase of Pareto’s, we may
say that the rent will be of a more or less permanent character,
according to the ease with which savings can be transformed into
capital of a more or less durable kind.<a name="FNanchor_1184" id="FNanchor_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> Dr. Marshall sums up his
subtle analysis of the problem under consideration as follows: “In
passing from the free gifts of nature through the more permanent
improvements in the soil, to less permanent improvements, to farm
and factory buildings, to steam-engines, etc., and finally to the less
durable and less slowly made implements we find a continuous series
[of rents].”<a name="FNanchor_1185" id="FNanchor_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span></p>

<p>The series, we might add, may be extended to a point at which
rent becomes negative, <i>i.e.</i> until the conditions of demand and
supply become such that the factor of production which previously
yielded a supplementary revenue no longer gives even the normal
rate of remuneration. Thünen had suggested the possibility of a
negative rent, and the idea has been further developed by Pareto.</p>

<p>These modern writers seem to regard rent simply as a result
of the ordinary operation of the laws of supply and demand. The
concept rent has been generalised so that it can no longer be regarded
as a curiosity or an anomaly. The law of diminishing returns
loses much of its economic importance, and even the Ricardian theory
which is based upon it seems imperilled. After the numerous
polemics to which it has given rise, it seems as if this theory, along
with the Classical theory of value, were about to be relegated to the
class of doctrines in which the historian is still interested but which
are apparently of little practical value.<a name="FNanchor_1186" id="FNanchor_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading74">II: UNEARNED INCREMENT AND THE PROPOSAL TO
CONFISCATE RENT BY MEANS OF TAXATION</h4>

<p>It does not appear that Ricardo fully realised the damaging consequences
which would ensue if the doctrine of rent ever happened
to be made the basis of an attack upon the institution of private
property. He was quite satisfied with the inference which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
drawn from it in support of the free importation of corn, and did
not feel called upon to defend the rent of land any more than the
interest of capital, both of which seemed inseparable from a conception
of private property.</p>

<p>Other writers proved more exacting. Despite the numerous
exceptions met with in actual life, the feeling that all forms of
revenue ought to be justified by some kind of personal effort on the
part of the beneficiary is fairly deeply rooted in our moral nature.
But according to the Ricardian theory the rent of land is a kind of
income got without corresponding toil—a reward without merit,
and as such it is unjust. Such seems to be the logical conclusion of
the Ricardian thesis.</p>

<p>The conclusion thus established is further confirmed by the
natural feeling that not only is rent unjust, but the whole institution
of private property as well. This feeling is one which all of us
share (except those fortunate individuals who happen to be landlords,
perhaps!), and is, of course, much older than any doctrine
of rent. Movable property is generally the personal creation of
man, the result of the toil or the product of the savings, if not of the
present possessor, at least of a former one. But land is a gift of
nature, a bountiful creation of Providence placed at the disposal
of everyone without distinction of wealth or of station. Proudhon’s
celebrated dictum is known to most people: “Who made the land?
God. Get thee hence, then, proprietor.”<a name="FNanchor_1187" id="FNanchor_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> That line of argument
is really very old, and Ricardo unwittingly gave it new strength.</p>

<p>The idea of a natural right to the land and of a common interest
in it is the instinctive possession of every nation. But in England
the feeling seems more general than elsewhere, because, possibly, of
the number of large proprietors and of the serious abuses to which
the system has given rise. It seems rooted in the legal traditions
of the nations. “No absolute ownership of land,” writes Sir
Frederick Pollock, “is recognised by our law-books except in the
Crown. All lands are supposed to be held, immediately or mediately,
of the Crown, though no rent or services may be payable, and no
grant from the Crown on record.”<a name="FNanchor_1188" id="FNanchor_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> Even as far back as the
seventeenth century, Locke, in his work <i>On Civil Government</i>, had
ventured to declare that God had given the land as common
property to the children of men.</p>

<p>As one approaches the end of the eighteenth century the demands
that all lands unlawfully taken from the public should be again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
restored to it become much more frequent. Sometimes the demand
is put forward by otherwise obscure writers, but occasionally it
finds support in distinguished and influential quarters. In 1775
a Newcastle schoolmaster of the name of Thomas Spence, in the
course of a lecture given before the Philosophical Society of that
town, proposed that the parishes should again seize hold of the land
within their own area. Thereupon he was obliged to flee to London,
where he carried on an active propaganda in support of these ideas,
achieving a certain measure of success. In 1781 a distinguished
professor of the University of Aberdeen of the name of Ogilvie published
an anonymous essay on the rights of landed proprietorship,
wherein confiscation was proposed by taxing the whole of the value
of the soil which was not due to improvements effected by proprietors.
But little notice was taken of his suggestions, despite the
fact that they had won the approval of Reid the philosopher. Tom
Paine, in a pamphlet published in 1797, gave expression to similar
ideas,<a name="FNanchor_1189" id="FNanchor_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> and the same views were put forward in a book published in
1850 by a certain Patrick Edward Dove.<a name="FNanchor_1190" id="FNanchor_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> The following year
Herbert Spencer, in his book <i>Social Statics</i>, claimed that the State in
taking back the land would be “acting in the interests of the highest
type of civilisation” and in perfect conformity with the moral law.
It is true that in a subsequent work he took pains to point out that
all that can be claimed for the community is the surface of the
country in its original unsubdued state. “To all that value given to
it by clearing, making up, prolonged culture, fencing, draining,
making roads, farm buildings, etc., constituting nearly all its value,
the community has no claim.”<a name="FNanchor_1191" id="FNanchor_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> But despite this reservation the
justice of the general principle is clearly recognised by him.</p>

<p>Other communities besides England have put forward a similar
demand. Not to mention the claims made by socialists like
Proudhon and the Belgian Baron Colins, and Christian Socialists
like François Huet, we find that a similar method of procedure is
advocated by philosophers like Renouvier, Fouillée, and Secrétan.
Some of them even go the length of claiming compensation for the
loss which this usurpation has involved to the present generation.</p>

<p>Thus, a conception that was already ancient even when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
law of rent was first formulated proclaimed the inalienable right
of man to the soil and demanded the re-establishment of that right.
We shall hear an echo of that ancient belief in all the advocates of
land nationalisation, in Stuart Mill, Wallace, Henry George, and
Walras;<a name="FNanchor_1192" id="FNanchor_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> and this is one of the many links that bind them to those
earlier writers. Gossen is a solitary exception.</p>

<p>But a simple pronouncement on the illegality of property does
not take us very far. Appropriation of public property for private
purposes is undoubtedly a great injustice, but the transaction is
so old that retribution would serve little useful purpose, and the
authors, were they still alive, would be safely ensconced behind
their prescriptive rights. Moreover, most of the present proprietors,
possibly all of them, cannot be accused of violent theft. They have
acquired their land in a perfectly regular fashion, giving of their toil
or their savings in exchange for it. To them it is merely an instrument
of production, and their possession of it as legally justifiable
as the ownership of a machine or any other form of capital. To
take it away from them without some indemnity would not be to
repair the old injustice, but to create a new one. Hence it is that
the doctrine of the right of the community to the land had little
more than philosophic interest until such time as it begot a new
theory—the theory of rent.</p>

<p>What the Ricardian theory really proves is the accumulative
nature of the benefits accruing from the possession of land. This
spontaneous, automatic character of rent makes it unique: to no
other form of revenue does it belong. The extension of cultivation,
the increase of population, the growing demand for commodities,
means an indefinite progression in the value of land. The interest,
initiative, and intelligence of the proprietor are of no account.
Everything depends upon the development of the social environment.
This value which is created by the community should also
belong to it. Just as the landed proprietors in times past filched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
the land, so they to-day absorb this income. But why allow this
injustice to continue?</p>

<p>“Suppose,” says Stuart Mill, “that there is a kind of income
which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice
on the part of the owners, these owners constituting a class in the
community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches
consistently with complete passiveness on their own part. In such
a case it would be no violation of the principles on which private
property is founded if the State should appropriate this increase of
wealth, or part of it, as it arises. This would not properly be taking
anything from anybody; it would merely be applying an accession
of wealth created by circumstances to the benefit of society, instead
of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a
particular class. Now this is actually the case with rent.”<a name="FNanchor_1193" id="FNanchor_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> The
argument seems quite decisive. At any rate, Ricardo’s book was
hardly out of the press before the demand for confiscation was
renewed.</p>

<p>His friend James Mill, writing in 1821, claimed that the State
could legitimately appropriate to itself not only the present rent of
land, but also all future increments of the same, with a view to
compensating for public expenditure.<a name="FNanchor_1194" id="FNanchor_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> The Saint-Simonians, a
little later, expressed a similar view.<a name="FNanchor_1195" id="FNanchor_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> But it was James Mill’s
son, John Stuart Mill, who showed the warmest attachment to
this idea. The <i>Principles</i> contains a general outline of his reform
plan, which took a still more definite shape in the programme of
the Land Tenure Reform Association, founded in 1870, and in
the discussions and explanations which accompanied it.<a name="FNanchor_1196" id="FNanchor_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a></p>

<p>The following are the essential points: (1) The State will only
appropriate for its own use the future rents of land; that is, the
rents paid after the proposed reform has been accomplished. (2) A
practical beginning will be made by valuing the whole of the land,
and a periodical revaluation will be made with a view to determining
the increase in its value, and whether such increase is or is not the
result of communal activity. A general tax would transfer this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
benefit to the State.<a name="FNanchor_1197" id="FNanchor_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> (3) Should any proprietor consider himself
unfairly treated the State would give him the option of paying the
new tax or of buying back the property at the price obtainable for
it had he determined to sell just when the reform was being
brought in.</p>

<p>Mill was opposed to immediate nationalisation. Not that he
thought it unjust; on the contrary, he was fully convinced of its
equity. But our experience of State administration and of the work
of municipal bodies did not seem to him to warrant any great faith
in the utility of any such measure. He was afraid that “many
years would elapse before the revenue realised for the State would
be sufficient to pay the indemnity which would be justly claimed by
the dispossessed proprietors.”<a name="FNanchor_1198" id="FNanchor_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<p>Nor did he attempt to disguise the fact that the financial results
would in his opinion be somewhat insignificant and the scope of the
reform naturally somewhat limited. A few years only were to
elapse before another writer proposed a much more radical measure
which was to effect a veritable social revolution. It was a project
to abolish poverty and to secure distributive justice that Henry
George now launched on the strength of his belief in the doctrine of
rent.</p>

<p>Henry George (1839-1897) was not a professional economist.
He was a self-made, self-taught man who followed a variety of
occupations before he finally blossomed forth as a publicist. At
the age of sixteen he went to sea, and led a roving life until 1861,
when he settled down at San Francisco as a compositor, finally
becoming editor of a daily paper in that city. He witnessed the
rapid expansion of San Francisco and the development of the
surrounding districts as the result of the great influx of gold-diggers.
He also saw something of the agricultural exploitation of the western
States. The enormous increase in the value of land and the fever
of speculation which resulted from this naturally left a lasting
impression upon him. <i>Progress and Poverty</i> (1879), the book which
established his fame, is wholly inspired by these ideas.<a name="FNanchor_1199" id="FNanchor_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>

<p>The book aroused the greatest enthusiasm. It has all the liveliness
of journalism and the eloquence of oratory, but has neither the
precision nor the finality of a work of science. Its economic heresies,
though obvious enough, detracted nothing from its powerful appeal,
and the wonderful setting in which the whole problem of poverty
was placed has not been without its effect even upon economists;<a name="FNanchor_1200" id="FNanchor_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>
nor is the powerful agitation to which the book gave rise by any
means extinct.</p>

<p>It seemed to Henry George that landed proprietors, in virtue
of the monopoly which they possess, absorb not merely a part but
almost the whole of the benefits which accrue from the increase of
population and the perfection of machinery. The progress of
civilisation seems helpless to narrow the breach separating the rich
from the poor. While rents go up interest goes down and wages
fall to a minimum. Every country presents the same phenomena—extreme
poverty at one end of the scale accompanied by extravagant
luxury at the other.</p>

<p>Is this unhappy result a kind of hybrid begotten of the Malthusian
law and the law of diminishing returns? Must we, after all,
agree with Malthus, Ricardo, and Mill when they say that the cause
is to be sought in the increase of population outrunning the means
of subsistence? Henry George thinks not, for experience everywhere
seems to show that the rich are growing in numbers much more
rapidly than the growth of population warrants, and that organisation
is really performing wonderful feats under very difficult conditions.<a name="FNanchor_1201" id="FNanchor_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a></p>

<p>Is it caused by the exploitation of labour by capital, as the
socialists seem to think? George apparently thinks not, for the
two factors, capital and labour, seem to him so intimately connected
that both of them are easily exploited by the landowners.
Every man, he thinks, could devote his energies either to the production
of capital or to supplying labour—capital and labour being
merely different manifestations of the same force, human effort.
The benefits resulting from the formation of capital on the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
hand and from the exercise of labour on the other tend to be equal,
and any inequality is immediately counteracted by a larger production
of one or other of these two factors, with the result that equilibrium
is soon re-established. The rate of interest and the rate of
wages can never vary inversely.<a name="FNanchor_1202" id="FNanchor_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a></p>

<p>But if we can neither accuse over-population nor lay the blame
at the door of exploitation, how are we to account for the fact that
the labourer is still so miserably paid? It is entirely, he thinks, the
result of rent. Hitherto exceedingly severe in his handling of
some Ricardian theories, George has no hesitation in pushing the
doctrine of rent to its extreme limits.</p>

<p>He points out that owing to the existence of competition between
capital and labour the rates of interest and wages are determined
by the yield of that capital and labour when applied to land on
the margin of cultivation—that is, to land that yields no surplus
or rent. And in virtue of the natural monopoly which landowners
possess they can exact for the use of other lands any amount they
like beyond this minimum. The result is that rent goes on gradually
increasing as the limits of cultivation extend. As population
grows and needs become more extensive and varied, as technical
processes become more perfect and labour becomes less and less
necessary, new lands are brought under cultivation, such lands
being generally of an inferior character. The result is that the
lands which were previously cultivated will always yield a rent
to the proprietor. Thus the progress of civilisation, whatever
form it take, always tends to the same result—a higher rent for the
benefit of the landed proprietor.<a name="FNanchor_1203" id="FNanchor_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here is a little village; in ten years it will be a great city—in
ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage-coach,
the electric light of the candle; it will abound with all the
machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective
power of labour. Will, in ten years, interest be any higher?”
He will tell you “No!” “Will the wages of common labour be
any higher?” He will tell you “No!” “What, then, will be
higher?” “Rent: the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of
ground, and hold possession.… You may sit down and smoke
your pipe; you may lie around like the <i>lazzaroni</i> of Naples or the
lepers of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon or down a hole in
the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding
one iota to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will
be rich! In the new city you may have a luxurious mansion;
but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.”<a name="FNanchor_1204" id="FNanchor_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly Henry George regards rent not so much as a species
of revenue which, as Stuart Mill saw, is particularly easy to absorb
by means of taxation, but as the very source of all evil. Once
get rid of rent, poverty will be banished, inequality of wealth will
be removed, and economic crises—which George thought were
the result of speculation in land—will no longer disturb the serenity
of commercial life. But it is hardly enough to aim at the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
increments of rent, for the damning consequences of privilege would
still remain if landowners were allowed to retain even their present
rents. The whole abomination must be taxed out of existence.<a name="FNanchor_1205" id="FNanchor_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>
Such a tax would yield sufficient to defray all State expenditure,
and other forms of taxation could then be dispensed with. In the
single tax advocated by Henry George we have a curious revival of
the Physiocrats’ <i>impôt unique</i>.</p>

<p>George’s system is open to serious criticism both from the
economic and from the ethical standpoint. From the economic
point of view it is obvious that the right of private property does
confer upon the proprietor the right to such benefit as may accrue
from a possible surplus value, but it is not at all clear—nor has
George succeeded in proving it—that such a right absorbs the <i>whole</i>
benefit which accrues from social progress. Besides, it seems rather
childish to think that rent is the sole cause of poverty and that its
confiscation would result in the removal of the evils of poverty.</p>

<p>From the point of view of equity it seems clear that George in
removing one injustice is at the same time creating another. To rob
the present proprietors of the rents which they draw is simply to
deprive them of advantages which many of them have acquired
either by means of labour or economy. Land is no longer acquired
merely by occupation: the usual way of getting hold of it to-day
is to buy it. And if we consider that such a transaction is just,
we are bound to recognise the legitimacy of rent just as much as
the interest of capital. Confiscation might be justified in the case
of those who first unlawfully occupied the land. But how many
of them are left now?</p>

<p>Further, if we are going to relieve the landowner of the rent
which results from the progress of civilisation, we ought to indemnify
him for any “decrement” which may have resulted through no
error of his. Stuart Mill anticipated this objection<a name="FNanchor_1206" id="FNanchor_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> and gave the
dissatisfied proprietor the option of selling his land at a price equal
to its market value at the time when the reform was inaugurated.<a name="FNanchor_1207" id="FNanchor_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
Henry George apparently never faced this aspect of the question.
He thought that “decrement” would be very exceptional indeed,
and that the persistence of increment values is as thoroughly established
as any law in the physical world ever was.</p>

<p>Mill’s system, though much more moderate than George’s, is
by no means beyond reproach. The common element in both
systems—i.e. the emphasis laid upon unearned increments—has
been criticised both by socialists and economists.</p>

<p>The socialists point out that if the object is to get rid of unearned
incomes the interest of capital as well as the rent of land ought to
be confiscated. While agreeing with the object, they claim that
they are more logical in demanding the extinction of both kinds.
But this criticism is not quite a complete answer to Mill and his
supporters, for the latter regarded interest as the legitimate remuneration,
if not of the labour, at least of the abstinence of the capitalist.
Interest is the remuneration of sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_1208" id="FNanchor_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> But the socialists
are not convinced. They cannot see how the negative effort of the
capitalist is to be compared with the positive effort of the labourer,
and they have not been sparing in their denunciation of Mill and
his followers.</p>

<p>The economists adopt a different line of criticism. The argument
is that the rent of land is illegal because the progress of society has
contributed more to it than the work of the proprietor. But is
there any kind of revenue which is altogether free from such criticism?
Every kind of revenue contains some elements that are
essentially social in character; that is, elements that depend entirely
upon the demands of society. The growth of social demand often
brings to capital as well as to land, to labour as well as to capital,
quite unexpected and occasionally extravagant incomes. Has not
political economy in the course of its development been forced
to recognise the existence of a whole series of rents differing from
the rent of land merely in respect of their shorter duration? Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
the fortune of the celebrated hunchback of Quincampoix Street,
who lived in the glorious days of Law’s system, in any way different
from the fortune of the Duke of Westminster, who owns large areas
of the city of London? Or is the surplus value conferred upon old
capital by a mere fall in the rate of interest in any respect different
from the surplus value acquired by land under the pressure of
growing population? The most striking thing, apparently, about
unearned increment is its ubiquity. Society, presumably, does
not distribute its revenues in the way a schoolmaster rewards the
most painstaking or the most meritorious pupil. It puts a premium
upon the services that are rarest, but never inquires whether they
involved any greater amount of sacrifice. Such premiums simply
denote the intensity of its own demands. What right have we
to isolate one of these and demand that it and it alone shall be
confiscated?</p>

<p>Stuart Mill has given the only reply that is possible by showing
that none of the other rents has either the persistence or the generality
of the rent of land.<a name="FNanchor_1209" id="FNanchor_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> That reply seems clear enough to justify
at least a partial application of the systems of Henry George and
Stuart Mill.</p>

<p>About the year 1880 several leagues were founded in England,
America, and Australia with a view to propagating what George’s
followers call his “sublime truths.” During the last few years
they have not been nearly so active, although several attempts have
since been made, especially by municipalities, to tax surplus values.<a name="FNanchor_1210" id="FNanchor_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a>
Even as far back as 1807 a law was passed in France requiring
riparian owners to pay compensation in cases where their estates
bordered upon public works which in any way contributed to the
greater value of the property. But the law is very seldom enforced.<a name="FNanchor_1211" id="FNanchor_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
In London the principle was recognised as far back as the seventeenth
century, but has long since fallen into desuetude.<a name="FNanchor_1212" id="FNanchor_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> The
idea is again gaining ground very rapidly in England and Germany
especially. Numerous projects have been launched with a view to
taxing the surplus value of urban lands not used for building purposes,
and some of the schemes have been fairly successful. The
adoption of this principle was one of the more prominent features
of the famous English Budget of 1909, which roused so much opposition
and brought the long constitutional struggle between the
Liberal Government and the House of Lords to a head. The economists
are still divided on the question. The imposition of a <i>Werthzuwachssteuer</i>
by certain German municipalities led to a fresh discussion
of the topic in a number of reviews and polemical works,
but the principle stands enshrined in the German Imperial Act of
1911.</p>

<p>These ideas have never obtained the same hold in France, where
property is subdivided to a much greater extent than it is in England,
and where rent is accordingly distributed among a greater number
of cultivators and naturally raises less opposition. In addition to
this, the slow growth of the population in France makes the problem
less acute than it is in Germany, where the workers find that an
increasing proportion of wages is absorbed in the payment of rent.
But the question will demand attention sooner or later, and France,
like other countries, will have to look for an answer.</p>

<h4 id="heading75">III: SYSTEMS OF LAND NATIONALISATION</h4>

<p>The “land-nationalisers,” whose schemes now come under consideration,
not content with the taxation of a part of the revenue
of the land, demand that the whole of it should again become the
property of the State.</p>

<p>Apparently a much more thoroughgoing suggestion than any
of the preceding ones, especially Mill’s, in reality it is a much simpler
system that is proposed. The advocates of land nationalisation
think, with Mill, that the surplus value of the land should be reserved
for the State, and, like him, they have great faith in the persistence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
and continuity of this surplus value. They also agree with him
when he puts forward the claim of society to the possession of the
soil, but they never suggest that it should be taken from its present
owners. They reject the distinction between earned and unearned
income and consider that they are both equally legitimate. But,
unlike Mill, they never feel that they can say to the landed proprietor,
“Thus far and no farther.” Appropriation is advocated
simply on the ground of its public utility, and care is taken to hedge
it round with all kinds of guarantees. Proprietors are to be
indemnified not merely for the loss of income it would immediately
involve, but also for the loss of any future revenue upon which they
had reckoned. Could anything be simpler or more reasonable?</p>

<p>The practical interest of a system of this kind obviously cannot
be very great. Such a fundamental change in the institution of
private property, especially in old countries, could only be accomplished
by means of a revolution. Revolutions are to be undertaken
in no light-hearted fashion, and never without the sanction of absolute
necessity. Curiously enough, all the changes made in France, for
example, since the Revolution, in Russia since the emancipation of
the serfs, and in Ireland during the last hundred years have
been in the opposite direction. They have extended rather than
contracted the area of private property. Russia at the present
moment is engaged in this very task. The prospects of nationalisation
are certainly not very rosy. New countries may perhaps prove
more favourable grounds for experiment: there the State may
possibly show itself more jealous of its rights. But as a matter of
fact it is just in those countries that the State is most reckless,
the reason undoubtedly being that the abuses of private property
have not yet had time to make their influence felt.</p>

<p>The extremely hypothetical character of the schemes now under
consideration relieves us of the necessity of examining their organisation
in any detail, although this question of the minutiæ is apparently
one that strongly appeals to the creative instinct of these Utopians.</p>

<p>Of greater interest are the grounds on which they base their
demand and the economic processes by means of which they hope
to accomplish their aims. From this point of view the most interesting
systems are those of Gossen and Walras. Gossen’s scheme is
expounded in a curious volume entitled <i>Entwickelung der Gesetze
des menschlichen Verkehrs</i>, and Walras’s is developed in a memorandum
addressed by the author to the Vaudoise Society of Natural
Sciences in 1880. Both works contain ideas from which the
economist may learn a good deal, and both writers claim that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
successful adoption of their schemes would enable the State to make
an offer of free land to all citizens.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Gossen’s book appeared in 1853.<a name="FNanchor_1213" id="FNanchor_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> It is a curious coincidence
that the French Bastiat, the American Carey, and the German
Gossen should all be engaged in developing an optimistic thesis
just about the same time. Of the three, Gossen’s was the most optimistic
and by far the most scientific. He concurred in the judgment
of the Physiocrats, who believed that the world was providentially
subjected to the action of beneficent laws which men must know
and obey if they are ever to become happy. Such, he thought, are
the laws of enjoyment, or of utility or ophelimity, as we call them
to-day. A person who merely follows his own interests finds that
unconsciously, perhaps, he has been contributing to the happiness of
the whole of society. Gossen gives a remarkably clear proof of the
theory of maximum ophelimity, based upon a very ingenious analysis
of wants. According to this theory, every individual who pursues
the satisfaction of his own desires under a <i>régime</i> of free competition
helps in the realisation of the maximum satisfaction by everybody
concerned.</p>

<p>If it be true that each individual in pursuit of personal enjoyment
unwittingly contributes to the well-being of the whole community,
it is clear that everyone ought to be given the utmost
possible freedom in the pursuit of his interests. But there are
two great obstacles in the way of this. The first of these is want of
capital, which Gossen thought could be obviated by creating a huge
Government bank which would lend capital whenever required.
The mechanism of the bank is described in considerable detail.
The second obstacle is the existence of private property in land.
If man is to develop all his faculties and to use them to their
utmost extent in the production of wealth, he must be allowed to
choose his work freely and to carry it on under the most advantageous
circumstances possible. But private property hinders
free choice. “Thanks to this one fact,” says Gossen, “the obstinacy
of a single proprietor often hinders the best development of the
land which belongs to him and prevents its utilisation in the fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
that would best meet the needs of production. The necessity for the
compulsory purchase of land for industrial purposes, for the making of
roads, railways, or for developing mines, affords an indication of the
unsatisfactory condition of landholding as it exists at present.”<a name="FNanchor_1214" id="FNanchor_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a></p>

<p>It is obviously necessary that the community’s right to the soil
should again be restored to it, so that everyone might be free to
demand and to obtain the use of as much of it as he required. Every
industry could then choose that locality which seemed best fitted
for it. The right of using the land might be disposed of by public
auction and given to the bidder who offered the highest rent. There
would thus be a kind of guarantee that the organisation of production
at any one moment was being carried on in the most favourable
fashion—relatively, that is to say, to the knowledge possessed by
the community at that period.<a name="FNanchor_1215" id="FNanchor_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Walras’s position is not quite so frankly utilitarian as Gossen’s.
It was the analysis of the respective rôles of the individual and the
State, of which he gave an exposition in his lectures on <i>La Théorie
générale de la Société</i> (1867), that inspired his reform. Following Henry
George, he sought a reconciliation of individualism and socialism<a name="FNanchor_1216" id="FNanchor_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a>—a
reconciliation which he variously speaks of under the terms
“liberal socialism,” “synthetic socialism,” or simply “syntheticism.”<a name="FNanchor_1217" id="FNanchor_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a></p>

<p>It was his opinion that no real opposition existed between the
State and the individual, that the one is just the complement of
the other. Taken separately, it has been well said that they are
nothing better than abstractions; the only real man is the social
man—man living in society. This man, as we know, has two kinds
of interests—the one personal or individual, and as such opposed
to the interests of other beings; the other social or collective,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
common both to himself and his fellows—and unless these are secured
the existence of the race is immediately jeopardised. The two groups
of interests are equally important, for they are both equally necessary
for the life of the social being. The State and the individual are
mere phases in the life of the same being, according as we think
of him pursuing the collective interests which he has in common with
his fellow-men or his more personal and individual interests. Each
has its own sphere of activity definitely marked off from the other by
the diverse nature of the respective tasks which they have to perform.</p>

<p>The duty of the State is to secure those general conditions of
existence which are necessary for everybody alike. Upon the individual
devolves the duty of determining his own personal position
in society through perseverance in the exercise of his own capacity
in any line of activity which he may himself choose. But if both
of them, individual and State alike, are to perform their respective
tasks efficiently, they must be supplied with all necessary resources.
To the individual should accrue the wealth which results from
labour and saving, to the State the revenue which results from
general social progress—<i>i.e.</i> the rent of land. Provided for in the
manner indicated, there would be no necessity for taking away from
the individual a portion of the fruit of his labour by means of taxation.
Collective ownership of land and rent, private ownership of
capital and labour, together with their incomes—such is the social
organisation which Walras thought would solve the problem of
distribution: equal conditions, coupled with unequal situations.<a name="FNanchor_1218" id="FNanchor_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a></p>

<p>The reforms of Gossen and Walras, starting from a different angle
as they do, depend for their realisation upon conditions that are
exactly identical. Both of them evince the most scrupulous respect
for the prescriptive rights of the present owners; and both agree
that the State has no more right to appropriate future rents<a name="FNanchor_1219" id="FNanchor_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
which these owners rely, in the manner suggested by John Stuart
Mill, than it has to confiscate present rents, as Henry George
proposed. The only way in which reform can be fairly carried out is
to buy back the land, including in the purchase price any surplus
values upon which the present proprietors have set their hopes. The
most expedient way, perhaps, would be to issue bonds and to offer
these to the proprietors in exchange for the land. The rents, which
would still be received by the State—for there is no prospect of
cessation of growth—would be employed partly in paying interest
on the debt and partly in redeeming it; so that at the end of a
certain period, say fifty years, the State would have paid back all
the capital and it alone would henceforth draw the rents.<a name="FNanchor_1220" id="FNanchor_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a></p>

<p>It would have been unnecessary to add anything to the exposition
as given by Walras but for the objection which he himself raised
to it, and which led him to give a very interesting account of his
belief in the permanence of rent.</p>

<p>“If,” says Walras, “the State pays to the proprietors the
exact value of their lands, reckoning in that price a sum equal to
the estimated value of the future rent, what is it going to gain by
the bargain?” If the value of the soil is carefully computed in the
manner indicated above, then the interest on the capital borrowed
to effect the purchase and the rents received must exactly balance
one another, for one is just the price of the other, and the State will
find that the rent of land is insufficient to repay the outlay
involved. The results will cancel one another. Some inconveniences
will doubtless be avoided, but there will be no outstanding
advantage. How are we to get rid of this objection?</p>

<p>The difficulty is soon removed, for once the system outlined
above is adopted there will be an end to all speculation in land.
When individual buyers find that they must pay the owners a price
that covers all surplus values which the land may possibly yield in
the future, which would mean that <i>they</i> would not get any of that
surplus value themselves, they will not be quite so keen. This is
not the case, however, at the present time. Speculation of this
kind is rife everywhere, for the good reason that a surplus value
is always a possible contingency. The more perspicacious or better
informed a buyer is, the more firmly does he believe in this advance
and the more careful is he to safeguard his future interests. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
State, so soon as it has bought back the land, will be in the position
of the speculator in question. Walras is of the opinion that the
surplus value is certain to grow in future even more rapidly than
the actual possessors of the land imagine. Thanks to economic
evolution, what the private proprietor can only speculate on the
State can rely upon with absolute certainty.<a name="FNanchor_1221" id="FNanchor_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a></p>

<p>“I believe, along with several competent economists, that when
humanity left the purely agricultural system under which it had
lived for thousands of years and entered upon a <i>régime</i> of industry
and commerce, under which agriculture is still necessary to feed a
growing population, but only possible with the expenditure of a vast
amount of capital, it achieved a notable triumph, and the step it
then took marks a veritable advance in economic evolution. I also
believe that as the result of this evolution rent will continue to
grow, but without involving any scarcity or increase in the value
of agricultural produce—a fact that has escaped everyone except
the wideawake and the well-informed, and by which proprietors
alone have profited. I further believe that if the State had bought
the land before this evolution had taken place and had then given
of its resources to further such development, even the normal
growth of this surplus value would have been ample to clear the
debt.”<a name="FNanchor_1222" id="FNanchor_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a></p>

<p>Walras agrees with Ricardo, and a kind of rehabilitation of the
Ricardian thesis drives him to the conclusion that the future must
witness a further growth of this surplus value of land—merely
because of the limited quantity of land in existence. There is this
difference, however. Whereas Ricardo bases his whole contention
upon the validity of the law of diminishing returns, Walras will
not even entertain the thought of a possible diminution in the
amount of agricultural produce. The inevitable progress of society
which leads it on from a purely agricultural stage right up to the
industrial-commercial stage, from extensive to intensive cultivation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
must result in increasing the value of land. The State would ease
this transitional process by a measure of appropriation, and could
make a solid contribution to the success of this gigantic undertaking,
which is to apply not merely to land, but also to railways and
mines, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1223" id="FNanchor_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Numerous and various are the reasons invoked by the advocates
of land nationalisation. Gossen’s ideal is the maximum product,
while Walras’s first care is to supply the State with all necessary
resources. A final class of writers regards it as an excellent opportunity
of giving everybody access to the soil. It was this ideal
of free land that inspired the late Alfred Russel Wallace to
write his book <i>Land Nationalisation: its Necessity and its Aims</i>,
and to inaugurate his campaign in favour of nationalisation in 1882.</p>

<p>Wallace imagined that the mere right of free land would put an
end for ever to the worker’s dependence upon the goodwill of the
capitalist. Nobody would be found willing to work for starvation
wages were everyone certain that on a free piece of land he would
always obtain his daily bread. None would suffer hunger any
longer, for the soil, at any rate, would always be there awaiting
cultivation. Free access to the land would by itself solve the
problem of poverty and want, and this would be by no means one
of the least of the benefits of land nationalisation.<a name="FNanchor_1224" id="FNanchor_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a></p>

<p>The essential thing, in his opinion, is to give to every worker the
right to possess and to cultivate a portion of the soil.<a name="FNanchor_1225" id="FNanchor_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> His proposal
is that once nationalisation is an accomplished fact every individual
at least once in his lifetime should be given the opportunity of
choosing a plot of land of from one to five acres in extent wherever
he likes on condition that he personally occupies and cultivates it.<a name="FNanchor_1226" id="FNanchor_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a></p>

<p>The extremely simple character of the proposal makes it all
the more notorious. Unlike the other schemes, it is not based<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
upon any subtle, complex economic analysis. But it supplies a most
convincing platform theme. Closer scrutiny, however, reveals its
almost childish nature.</p>

<p>The cultivation even of the smallest piece of land requires some
capital, which the advocates of free land appear to forget altogether.
The amount of capital so required may not infrequently be in excess
of the modest sum possessed by the working man. They also seem
oblivious of the fact that the land does not produce all the year
round: there must of necessity be a period of quiescence when the
seeds are germinating. And if we are to suppose that the worker has
sufficient reserve to wait for the harvest, why not admit at once
that he has also enough to tide over a period of unemployment?
A few pounds in the bank to which he can have access whenever
he likes would certainly be much more serviceable in mid-winter,
say, than a plot of land situated some distance away. Cultivation
also requires capacity as well as capital. You cannot improvise the
peasant, and a first-class artisan may be a very indifferent cultivator.
The experience of distress committees seems to prove this point.
The advocates of free land have a mistaken belief in the efficacy
of the proposed remedy, and experience would quickly show them
how difficult it would be to apply it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1227" id="FNanchor_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading76">IV: SOCIALIST EXTENSIONS OF THE
DOCTRINE OF RENT</h4>

<p>The writers who have hitherto engaged our attention were all of
them individualists. They had no quarrel with the institution of
private property as such, nor were they hostile to the existence of
capital or to the personal advantage which may accrue from the
possession of exceptional talent or ability. The orthodox socialist,
on the other hand, is distinguished by an aversion to both interest
and rent, and some of them even go the length of denying the
individual’s claim to any special benefit accruing from personal
ability if it has the effect of increasing his income beyond the mere
remuneration of labour.</p>

<p>Between the two conceptions is a veritable abyss, and the question
arises as to whether it can ever be bridged. Some writers
confidently reply in the affirmative. “It is the easiest thing in
the world. Just treat your interest on capital and the revenue
derived from exceptional capacity as rent, and the theory of rent
will supply a justification not only for the appropriation of land,
but also for universal collectivism.” It was in England that this
idea was first mooted.</p>

<p>England, the true home of socialism, the England of Godwin
and Hall, of Thompson and Owen, after the first outburst of socialist
activity over seventy years before, had not given birth to a single
socialist scheme. With the exception of John Stuart Mill, who was
impressed by the French socialists, English writers had remained
quite indifferent to the ideas that were agitating Europe. Karl
Marx toiled at the production of his masterpiece, <i>Das Kapital</i>,
in the very heart of London without arousing the curiosity of a
single English economist. The formation of socialist parties in
Germany and France after 1870 had to intervene before the ideas
of the great collectivist aroused any real enthusiasm in Great
Britain, and it was not until 1880 that a small Marxian party was
formed in England.<a name="FNanchor_1228" id="FNanchor_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> Just about the same time another group of
writers known as the Fabian Socialists began to preach an original
and characteristically English kind of socialism.<a name="FNanchor_1229" id="FNanchor_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a></p>

<p>The Fabian Society at first consisted of a small group of young
men, for the most part belonging to the middle classes, and holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
themselves aloof from the older political parties. The object was
“the prompt reconstruction of society in accordance with the
highest moral possibilities.” Success appearing somewhat remote,
and being anxious for more immediate results, they allowed themselves
to be led astray by ideas borrowed from the Marxian and
anarchist doctrines of the Continent. But they very soon renounced
the revolutionary spirit, which has so little in common with the
English temperament; and in order to emphasise the difference
between themselves and the advocates of brute force and the believers
in a sensational historical crisis<a name="FNanchor_1230" id="FNanchor_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> they adopted the name Fabian,
which is derived from Fabius Cunctator, the famous adversary of
Hannibal. The school has always been very critical both of itself
and of others, somewhat afraid of public ridicule, but possessing
none of the enthusiasm of apostles. Always ready to banter one
another,<a name="FNanchor_1231" id="FNanchor_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> to destroy their ancient idols, and to dispense with every
social or definitely political creed, the Fabians rapidly became transformed
into a society of students and propagandists whose interests
are exclusively intellectual, and who believe that “in the natural
philosophy of socialism light is a more important factor than heat.”<a name="FNanchor_1232" id="FNanchor_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a></p>

<p>Such an attitude is hardly conducive to success in a socialist
crusade, but the Fabians have left a deep impression—not so much
upon working men, perhaps, as upon members of the <i>bourgeois</i> or
middle class. Several of their members are persons of great literary
distinction, such as Mr. Bernard Shaw, the dramatist and critic, Mr.
and Mrs. Webb, the historians of <i>Industrial Democracy</i>, and Mr.
H. G. Wells, the novelist. By throwing themselves into the study
of social conditions of different kinds, by collaborating in the publication
of reviews and newspapers without distinction of party, by
publishing pamphlets and calling conferences, they have managed to
stimulate interest in their ideas. A <i>résumé</i> of these ideas is given in
a curious collection of articles entitled the <i>Fabian Essays</i>, published
in 1889. These essays represent the opinions of the more prominent
Fabians rather than of the Fabian Society, for the society as such has
only a practical policy, but no theoretical doctrine which it holds in
common. It calls itself socialist,<a name="FNanchor_1233" id="FNanchor_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> and would welcome the transformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
of individual into collective property. On the other hand,
it declares that it has “no distinctive opinions on the marriage question,
religion, art, abstract economics, historic evolution, currency,
or any other subject than its own special business of practical
democracy and socialism.”<a name="FNanchor_1234" id="FNanchor_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> The economic theories which immediately
interest us here are peculiar to certain members of the society.
The society as a whole was doubtless inspired by these ideas, but
they have not all received official recognition at its hands, and they
are not even accepted by some adherents of the school.<a name="FNanchor_1235" id="FNanchor_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a></p>

<p>It is Sidney Webb more especially who has essayed the task of
finding a new theoretical basis for Fabian collectivism. Having
rejected the Marxian theory of labour-value, and conscious of the
charm possessed by the modern theories of Jevons, of Marshall,
and the Austrians, he felt the need of some new justification for the
collective ownership of the means of production. Unable to free
himself from the fascination which Ricardo has always exercised
over his fellow-countrymen, he turns to the theory of rent of that
great economist, and that theory, in his opinion, is “the very corner-stone
of collectivist economy.”<a name="FNanchor_1236" id="FNanchor_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a></p>

<p>It is perfectly obvious that this theory of rent affords ample
justification for the appropriation of the revenue of land by proving
that this revenue is purely supplementary, produced as it is only
on the best lands and not on the worst, where the worker only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
produces the exact equivalent of his wages. There is nothing very
new in this, however.</p>

<p>Equally valid is its justification of confiscated interest. Different
kinds of capital, different machines, implements, and buildings, all
of which are employed for purposes of production, show the same
variety of quality, and consequently produce different quantities
of material goods, just as different lands do. The employee who
works with “marginal capital,” if we may so put it, or, in other
words, has to make shift with the minimum of tools and machinery,
without which no work at all would be possible, barely produces
the equivalent of his wages. Everything that exceeds this minimum
may be claimed by the capitalist as payment for the superior yield
of the capital which he has supplied. Interest, accordingly, is a
differential revenue—a rent which ought to be expressed as a definite
quantity of produce, for such it really is, and not as so much per
cent.<a name="FNanchor_1237" id="FNanchor_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a></p>

<p>Finally, any who possess superior ability as compared with those
who work not merely with a minimum of capital and labour, but
with a minimum of intelligence and ability, produce a surplus, which
they generally retain for themselves. This surplus is of the nature
of a differential rent—the rent of ability. Generally it is the result
of the better education received by the children of proprietors
and capitalists, and it is thus the indirect outcome of private
property.<a name="FNanchor_1238" id="FNanchor_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p>This ingenious argument is not very convincing. Even though
we admit that interest and possibly the greater portion of wages
may only be differential revenues, their confiscation would require
special justification. The attributes of capital, unlike those of land
as defined in the Ricardian theory, are not natural, but have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
conferred upon it by the efforts of human beings. And as to the
rent of ability, it still remains to be seen whether society would
benefit by the confiscation of this rent. As a scientific explanation
of distribution it does not seem to us a particularly attractive one.
The distribution of incomes is effected by means of exchange and
depends upon prices, but Webb makes an abstraction of prices in
order to concentrate upon the material product. We do not deny
the existence of rent derived from fixed capital, such rent being
approximately measured by comparison with the current rate of
interest. But after the labours of Böhm-Bawerk and Fisher it
would seem impossible to explain this rate itself by reference to the
material productivity of capital, which seems to be the essence of
Webb’s theory.</p>

<p>The latest attempt to deduce revolutionary conclusions from the
older economics and to found a theory of collectivism upon the
Ricardian doctrine of rent has proved a failure. Even Webb’s friends
have not shown the enthusiasm for it that they might<a name="FNanchor_1239" id="FNanchor_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>—and this
despite the constant allusion to the “three monopolies” which one
meets with in their writings.</p>

<p>The interest of the experiment lies not so much in itself as in
the indication which it affords of the more recent trend of thought
in this matter. We have already drawn attention to the fact that
the more immediate disciples of Marx both in France and Germany
have refuted his theory of value, showing a disposition to rally to
the counter-theory of final utility. We have here a group of English
socialists undergoing a somewhat similar process of evolution. On
every hand it seems that socialism has given up all pretension to
creating a working men’s political economy alongside of the <i>bourgeois</i>,
and it is now generally recognised that there can only be one political
economy, independent altogether of all parties and social ideals,
whose sole function is to give a scientific explanation of economic
phenomena.</p>

<p>The Fabians even outdo the syndicalists in their reaction against
the Marxian theories. Not only is the theory of value thrown
overboard, but Marx’s whole social doctrine is rejected as well.
There are two points on which the opposition is particularly marked,
and although these may be outside the scope of the present chapter
it is necessary to mention them in order to complete our exposition
of Fabian ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p>Marx’s social doctrine was built upon the theory of class war.
Socialism was simply the creed of the proletarian. Its triumph
would mean the victory of the proletariat over the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. Its
principles are the direct antithesis of those which govern society at
the present time, just as the two classes are directly opposed to one
another. The Fabians entertain no such views. They think of
socialism as a mere extension of the ideals of <i>bourgeois</i> democracy,
and they would be quite content with a logical development and
application of the principles which at present govern society. “The
economic side of the democratic ideal is, in fact, socialism itself,”
writes Sidney Webb.<a name="FNanchor_1240" id="FNanchor_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> Our object should not be to replace the
<i>bourgeois</i> supremacy by the proletarian ascendancy, nor even to
emancipate the worker from the tyranny of the wage system
(for under the socialist <i>régime</i>, as the Fabians point out, everybody
will be a wage-earner), but merely to organise industry in
the interest of the community as a whole. “We do not desire
to see the mines and the profits from the mines transferred to the
miners, but to the community as a whole.”<a name="FNanchor_1241" id="FNanchor_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> Socialism is not a
class doctrine, but a philosophy of general interest. “Socialism is
a plan for securing equal rights and opportunities for all.”<a name="FNanchor_1242" id="FNanchor_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> Webb
questions the existence of an English class struggle in the Marxian
sense of the word.<a name="FNanchor_1243" id="FNanchor_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> On the contrary: “In view of the fact that the
socialist movement has been hitherto inspired, instructed, and led
by members of the middle class or <i>bourgeoisie</i>, the Fabian Society
… protests against the absurdity of socialists denouncing the very
class from which socialism has sprung as specially hostile to it.”
One cannot see much similarity between this point of view and
that of the French syndicalists.<a name="FNanchor_1244" id="FNanchor_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p>

<p>The Fabian philosophy of history is equally distinct. For Marx
the capital fact in nineteenth-century history is the concentration of
property in the hands of a privileged few, and the consequent pauperisation
of the masses. The necessary consequence of this twofold
development will be the revolutionary dispossession of the former
by the latter.</p>

<p>Optimistic as they are, the Fabians are not prepared to deny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
the concentration of capital. According to their view, the prime
fact in nineteenth-century history is not the servility of the masses,
but the waning authority of the capitalists, the growing importance
of collective government in national economy, and the gradual
dispossession of the idlers for the sake of the workers, a process that
is already well on the way towards consummation. Webb is of the
opinion that socialism is being realised without any conflict, and
even with the tacit approval of its victims. “Slice after slice has
gradually been cut from the profits of capital, and therefore from its
selling value, by socially beneficial restrictions on its user’s liberty
to do as he liked with it. Slice after slice has been cut off the incomes
from rent and interest by the gradual shifting of taxation from
consumers to persons enjoying incomes above the average of the
kingdom.… To-day almost every conceivable trade is, somewhere
or other, carried on by parish, municipality, or the national
Government itself without the intervention of any middleman or
capitalist.… The community furnishes and maintains its own
museums, parks, art galleries, libraries, concert halls, roads, streets,
bridges, markets, slaughter-houses, fire-engines, lighthouses, pilots,
ferries, surf-boats, steam-tugs, lifeboats, cemeteries, public baths,
washhouses, pounds, harbours, piers, wharves, hospitals, dispensaries,
gasworks, waterworks, tramways, telegraph cables, allotments,
cow meadows, artisans’ dwellings, schools, churches, and
reading-rooms.” And even where private industry is allowed to
survive it is rigorously supervised and inspected. “The State
in most of the larger industrial operations prescribes the age of the
worker, the hours of work, the amount of air, light, cubic space,
heat, lavatory accommodation, holidays, and meal-times; where,
when, and how wages shall be paid; how machinery, staircases,
lift-holes, mines, and quarries are to be fenced and guarded; how
and when the plant shall be cleaned, repaired, and worked.…
On every side the individual capitalist is being registered, inspected,
controlled, and eventually superseded by the community.”<a name="FNanchor_1245" id="FNanchor_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a></p>

<p>We are already in the full current of socialism, declares Mr. Webb.
Our legislators are socialists without knowing it. “The economic
history of the century is an almost continuous record of the progress
of socialism.”<a name="FNanchor_1246" id="FNanchor_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> The Fabians, adopting a saying of the Saint-Simonians,
point out to the socialists that they ought to be content
with a clear exposition of the evolution of which everyone knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
something, although perhaps in a hazy fashion. “Instead of
unconscious factors we become deliberate agents either to aid or
resist the developments coming to our notice.”<a name="FNanchor_1247" id="FNanchor_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a></p>

<p>We are some distance away from Marx here, and farther still
from his syndicalist disciples. We have really been led back to the
philosophy of history as it was interpreted by the German State
Socialists. Must we, then, conclude that the Fabians are State
Socialists who feign ignorance of the fact?</p>

<p>Fabian socialism, strictly speaking, is not a new scientific doctrine.
It is rather a plea for economic centralisation, an idea begotten of
the modern conditions of existence in Europe, as against orthodox
Liberalism, which is somewhat threadbare but still holds an honourable
place in the opinion of many English writers. It is highly
probable that the legislative activity of the last thirty years, which
friends and foes alike regard as somewhat socialistic, will appear
to our descendants as a moderate movement in the direction of
greater centralisation.</p>

<p>English politics even long before this had begun to shake off its
individualism and to rid itself of the philosophic and political doctrines
of the utilitarian Radicals, which Bentham and his friends had
formulated early in the nineteenth century, and which still exercise
a considerable influence over some people. The Fabians regard
themselves as the special protagonists of the new standpoint. They
would be proud to consider themselves the intellectual successors
of the utilitarian Radicals, who simply claim to express the new desires
of a great industrial democracy. Labour legislation and its many
ramifications, municipal socialism spontaneously developing in all
the big towns, the great co-operative “wholesales” in Glasgow and
Manchester, furnish persuasive illustration of the practical socialism
which they advocate. “It is not,” writes Mrs. Sidney Webb,
“the socialism of foreign manufacture which cries for a Utopia
of anarchy to be brought about by a murderous revolution, but the
distinctively <i>English</i> socialism, the socialism which discovers itself
in works and not in words, the socialism that has silently embodied
itself in the Factory Acts, the Truck Acts, Employers’ Liability Acts,
Public Health Acts, Artisans’ Dwellings Acts, Education Acts—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
all that mass of beneficent legislation forcing the individual into the
service and under the protection of the State.”<a name="FNanchor_1248" id="FNanchor_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a></p>

<p>The Fabian doctrine is the latest avatar of the Ricardian theory.
It would really seem impossible to draw any further conclusions
from it. Everything that could possibly be attempted in that
direction has already been done, although other weapons of war
forged against the institution of private property may yet come
out of that old armoury. But that is hardly probable, especially when
we remember that economic science no longer regards rent as a kind
of anomaly amid the other economic phenomena. There is no doubt
as to its reality, but it has been deprived of much of the social
importance that was attributed to it by Ricardo and his followers,
and it has consequently lost much of its revolutionary fecundity.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III_THE_SOLIDARISTS">CHAPTER III: THE SOLIDARISTS</h3>

<h4 id="heading77">I: THE CAUSES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOLIDARISM</h4>

<p>The word “solidarity,” formerly a term of exclusively legal import,<a name="FNanchor_1249" id="FNanchor_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>
has during the last twenty years been employed to designate a
doctrine which has aroused the greatest enthusiasm—at least in
France. Every official speech pays homage to the ideal, every
social conference ends with an expression of approval. Those who
wish to narrow the scope of industrial warfare as well as those who
wish to extend the bounds of commercial freedom base their demands
upon “a sense of social solidarity,” and it is becoming quite a
common experience to find writers on ethics and education who
have fallen under its spell. The result is that no history of French
economic doctrines can pass it by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1250" id="FNanchor_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a></p>

<p>The fundamental idea underlying the doctrine of solidarity,
namely, that the human race, taken collectively, forms one single
body, of which individuals are the members, is not by any means new.
St. Paul and Marcus Aurelius among the writers of antiquity, not
to mention Menenius Agrippa’s well-known apologue, gave expression
to this very idea in terms almost identical with those now commonly
used.<a name="FNanchor_1251" id="FNanchor_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the importance of heredity wholly lost upon the ancients.
The hereditary transmission of moral qualities was a doctrine
taught with the express sanction of a revealed religion. This doctrine
of original sin is perhaps the most terrible example of solidarism
that history has to reveal. Turning to profane history, we are
reminded of the line of Horace:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Delicta majorum immeritus lues!</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We must also remember that it was always something more than
a mere theory or dogma. It was a practical rule of conduct, and
as such was enjoined by law, exhorted by religion, and enforced
by custom, with the result that what was preached was also practised
with a thoroughness that is quite unknown at the present day.
We have an illustration of this in the collective responsibility of all
the members of a family or tribe whenever one of their number was
found guilty of some criminal offence. A survival of this pristine
custom is the Corsican vendetta of to-day.</p>

<p>Finally, there is that other aspect of solidarity which is based
upon division of labour and the consequent necessity of relying upon
the co-operation of others for the satisfaction of our wants. The
Greek writers had caught a glimpse of this interdependence many
centuries before the brilliant exposition of Adam Smith was given
to the world.</p>

<p>All the manifold aspects of the doctrine, whether biological,
sociological, moral, religious, legal, or economic, were obviously
matters of common knowledge to the writers of antiquity. But each
phase of the subject seemed isolated from the rest, and it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
until the middle of the nineteenth century that it dawned upon
thinkers that there was possibly something like unity underlying this
apparent diversity. It has already been impressed upon us that
Pierre Leroux and a few of the disciples of Fourier, as well as Bastiat,
had realised something of the value of the doctrine of solidarity and
of the appropriateness of the term. But it was reserved for Auguste
Comte to appreciate its full possibilities. “The new philosophy,
viewed as a whole, emphasises the intimacy that exists between
the individual and the group in their different relations, so that
the conception of social solidarity extending throughout time and
embracing the whole of humanity has become a fairly familiar
idea.”<a name="FNanchor_1252" id="FNanchor_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a></p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to inquire somewhat more closely into
the success of the new doctrine in holding the attention both of
the public and of economists. It is possible that the seed would
have borne little fruit but for the presence of extraneous circumstances
which helped to impress the public with a sense of the
importance of these new theories.</p>

<p>Nothing has left a deeper impression upon the public or afforded
a better illustration of the infinite possibilities of the new doctrine
than the study of bacteriology. The prevalence of certain contagious
maladies or epidemics had been too terribly prominent in the history
of the human race to require any confirmation; but it was something
to learn that the most serious diseases and maladies of all
kinds were communicated from man to man by means of invisible
bacilli. It was now realised that men who were supposed to be
dying a natural death were in reality being slowly murdered. It
was with something like horror that men learned that the consumptive,
the hero of a hundred sentimental tales, every day expectorated
sufficient germs to depopulate a whole town. Such “pathological”
solidarity is being more closely interwoven every day by the ever-increasing
multiplicity and rapidity of the means of communication.
The slow caravan journey across the desert was much more likely
to destroy the vitality of the bacilli picked up at Mecca than the
much more rapid railway journey of the future, which will speed
the pilgrim across the sandy wastes in a few hours. The traveller
of former days, who went either afoot or on horseback, ran less
risk of infection than his descendant of to-day, who perhaps only
spends a few hours in the metropolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span></p>

<p>Sociology has also brought its contingent of facts and theories.<a name="FNanchor_1253" id="FNanchor_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>
The sociologist stakes his reputation upon being able to prove that
the fable of the body and its members is no fable at all, but a literal
transcription of actual facts, and that the union existing between
various members of the social body is as intimate as that which
exists between the different parts of the same organism. Such is
the fullness and minuteness with which the analogy has been pushed
even into obscure points of anatomical detail that it is difficult not
to smile at the <i>naïveté</i> of its authors. It is pointed out that so close
is the resemblance between the respective functions in the two
cases that the term “circulation” does duty in both spheres, and a
comparison is instituted between nutrition and production, reproduction
and colonisation, and accumulation of fat and capitalism. In
Florence during the Middle Ages the <i>bourgeois</i> were spoken of as
the fat people, the workers as the small people. The organs also
are very similar. Arteries and veins have their counterpart in
the railway system, with its network of “up” and “down”
lines. The nervous system of the one becomes the telegraphic
system of the other, with its rapid communication of news and
sensations. The brain becomes the seat of government, the
heart is the bank; and between the two, both in nature and in
society, there is a most intimate connection. Even the white
corpuscles have a prototype in the police force, whose duty is to rush
to the seat of disorder and to attempt to crush it immediately.</p>

<p>The sociological analogy, ingenious rather than scientific, did
not have a very long vogue.<a name="FNanchor_1254" id="FNanchor_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> But it has at least supplied a few
conclusions which are thoroughly well established, and which serve
as the basis of the solidarist doctrine. Among these we may
mention the following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That solidarity in the sense of the mutual dependence of
members of the same body is a characteristic of all life. Inorganic
bodies are incomplete simply because they are mere aggregates.
Death is nothing but the dissolution of the mysterious links which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
bind together the various parts of the living organism, with the
result that it relapses into the state of a corpse, in which the various
elements become indifferent to the presence of one another and are
dissipated through space, to enter into new combinations at the
further call of nature.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That solidarity becomes more perfect and intimate with every
rise in the biological scale. Completely homogeneous organisms
scarcely differ from simple aggregates. They may be cut into
sections or have a member removed without suffering much damage.
The section cut off will become the centre of independent existence
and the amputated limb will grow again. In the case of some
organisms of this kind reproduction takes the form of voluntary or
spontaneous segmentation. But in the case of the higher animals the
removal of a single organ sometimes involves the death of the whole
organism, and almost always imperils the existence of some others.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That a growing differentiation of the parts makes for the
greater solidarity of the whole. Where every organ is exactly alike
each is generally complete in itself. But where they are different
each is just the complement of the other, and none can move or
exist independently of the rest.</p>

<p>One has only to think of the treatment meted out to the
innovator by primitive tribes to realise the tremendous solidarity
of savage society. The “boycotting” familiar in civilised countries
provides a similar example.</p>

<p>Political economy, in addition to an unrivalled exposition of
division of labour (which, as we have seen, was not unknown in
classical times), has adduced several other incidental proofs of
solidarity, such as bank failures in London or Paris and short time
in the diamond or automobile industry as the result of a crisis in
New York or an indifferent rice harvest in India. To take a
simpler case, consider how easy it would be for the secretary of an
electrical engineers’ union to plunge whole cities into darkness.
The general strike, the latest bugbear of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, owes its
very existence to the growing sense of solidarity among working men.
A sufficient number of workmen have only to make up their minds to
remain idle and society has either to give way to their demands or
perish.</p>

<p>Add to this the remarkable development which has taken place
in the spreading of news and the perfecting of telegraphic communication,
by which daily and even hourly men of all nations are
swayed with feelings of sorrow or joy at the mere recital of some
startling incident which formerly would have influenced but a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
small number of people.<a name="FNanchor_1255" id="FNanchor_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> Such agencies are not unworthy of comparison
with those subtle human sympathies which are known by
the name of spiritualism or telepathy. Thus from every side, from
the limbo of occultism as well as from the full daylight of everyday life,
the presence of numberless facts goes to show that each for all and
all for each is not a mere maxim or counsel of perfection, but a
stern, practical fact. The good or bad fortune of others involves our
own well-being or misfortune. The <i>ego</i>, as someone has said, is a
social product. These are some of the founts from which the stream
of solidarism take its rise.</p>

<p>But that is not all. The doctrine of solidarity had the good
fortune to appear just when people were becoming suspicious of
individualist Liberalism, though unwilling to commit themselves
either to collectivism or State Socialism.</p>

<p>In France especially a new political party in process of formation
was on the look-out for a cry. The new creed which it desired must
needs be of the nature of a <i>via media</i> between economic Liberalism on
the one hand and socialism on the other. It must repudiate <i>laissez-faire</i>
equally with the socialisation of individual property; it must
hold fast to the doctrine of the rights of man and the claims of the
individual while recognising the wisdom of imposing restrictions
upon the exercise of those rights in the interests of the whole community.
This was the party which called itself Radical then, but
now prefers to be known as the Radical-Socialist party. German
State Socialism as expounded about the same time was closely akin
to it. But the German conception of the State as something entirely
above party was an idea that was not so easily grasped in France as
in Prussia. History in the two countries had not emphasised the
same truths. Solidarism, so to speak, is State Socialism in a French
garb, but possessed of somewhat better grace in that it does not
necessarily imply the coercive intervention of the State, but shows
considerable respect for individual liberties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1256" id="FNanchor_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a></p>

<p>The new word performed one final service by usurping the
functions of the term “charity,” which no one was anxious to retain
because of its religious connection. The other term, “fraternity,”
which had done duty since the Revolution of 1848, was somewhat
antiquated by this time, and charged with a false kind of sentimentalism.
The word “solidarity,” on the contrary, has an imposing,
scientific appearance without a trace of ideology. Henceforth every
sacrifice which is demanded in the interests of others, whether grants
to friendly societies or workmen’s associations, cheap dwellings,
workmen’s pensions, or even parish allowances, is claimed, not in the
interests of charity, but of solidarity. And whenever such demand
is made the approved formula is always used—it is not a work of
charity, but of solidarity, for charity degradeth whereas solidarity
lifteth up.</p>

<h4 id="heading78">II: THE SOLIDARIST THESIS</h4>

<p>The current is seldom very clear when the tributaries are numerous,
and the stream must deposit its sediment before it becomes limpid.
So here much greater precision was needed if the doctrine was ever
to become general in its scope or even popular in its appeal.</p>

<p>M. Léon Bourgeois, one of the leaders of the Radical-Socialist
party, to his eternal credit attempted some such clarification by
employing the term “solidarity,” hitherto so vaguely metaphysical,
in a strictly legal fashion to designate a kind of quasi-contract.
Quite a sensation was caused by M. Bourgeois’s work—a result due
alike to the prominent position of the author and the opportune
moment at which the book appeared. The greatest enthusiasm
was shown for the new doctrine, especially in the universities and
among the teachers in 100,000 elementary schools. An equally
warm welcome was extended to it in democratic circles, where the
desire for some kind of lay morality had by this time become very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
strong. It becomes necessary, accordingly, to give a more detailed
analysis of the theory than was possible within the compass of the
small volume in which it was first expounded.<a name="FNanchor_1257" id="FNanchor_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>

<p>In the first place it must be noted that the doctrine connotes
something more than the mere application or extension of the idea
of natural solidarity to the social or moral order. On the contrary,
it is an attempt to remove some of the anomalies of natural solidarity.
A firm belief in the injustice of natural solidarity, or at least a
conviction that things are so adjusted that some individuals obtain
advantages which they by no means deserve while others are
burdened with disadvantages which are none of their seeking, lies
at the root of the doctrine. There is a demand for intervention in
order that those who have benefited by the accidents of natural
solidarity should divide the spoils with those who have been less
fortunate in drawing prizes in the lottery of life. It is for Justice to
restore the balance and correct the abnormalities which a fickle sister
has created. Just as it has been seen that man may utilise the forces
of nature, against which he formerly was wont to struggle, to further
his own ends, so solidarity puts forth a claim for the co-operation of
Justice to correct the anomalies begotten of brute strength, believing
that only in this way is real advance possible or any kind of improvement
even remotely attainable.</p>

<p>Natural solidarity<a name="FNanchor_1258" id="FNanchor_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> tells us that as a result of the division of labour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
of the influence of heredity, and of a thousand other causes which have
just been described, every man owes either to his forbears or his contemporaries
the best part of what he has, and even of what he himself
is. As Auguste Comte has put it, “We are born burdened with all
manner of social obligations.” Nor is it an uncommon thing to
meet with the word “debt” or “obligation” in the articles of the
French Constitution. In the Constitution of 1793, for example, the
duty of public assistance is spoken of as a sacred debt. But the
term was loosely employed in the sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i> or <i>richesse
oblige</i>, every individual being left free to carry out the obligation as
best he could in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience.
It is necessary, however, to transform the duty into a real debt, to
give it a legal status, and when not voluntarily performed a legal
sanction as well. If we are anxious to know exactly how this is to
be done we have only to turn to Articles 1371-81 of the Civil Code,
where in the chapter dealing with quasi-contracts we shall come
across a section headed “Of Non-conventional Contracts.”</p>

<p>The title would seem to imply the validity of debts not explicitly
contracted—that is to say, the existence of obligations which have
not involved any volitional undertaking on the part of either party
concerned. The first case, that of injury inflicted upon others,
whether wilfully or not, is referred to as quasi-misdemeanour, and
other instances mentioned in the section are spoken of as quasi-contracts.
Illustrations, which are plentiful enough, include payments
made when not really due, attention to the business of
another without any definite mandate authorising such interference,
the obligation of the inheritor of property to pay off debts
incurred by the previous owner, the recognition of the common
interest which people living in the same neighbourhood possess,
and which also exists between those who own property and
those who lease it, between those who use it and those who
inherit it.</p>

<p>Wherever anything of the nature of a quasi-contract exists we
may be tolerably certain that it is the product of <i>de facto</i> or natural
solidarity. Such solidarity may take its rise in the mere fact of
propinquity or the mere feeling of neighbourliness; but more often
than not it involves a measure of control over the lives of others,
which is one of the outstanding features of a <i>régime</i> of division of
labour. Then follow the familiar phenomena of fortunes amassed
to the detriment of others through the acquisition of unearned
increment and the operation of the laws of inheritance—the source
of so many inequalities. Nor must we forget the prejudicial effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
of quasi-misdemeanour upon the fortunes of others. The result is
that the whole of society seems built, if not upon an original explicit
contract, as Rousseau imagined, at least upon a quasi-contract; and
seeing that this quasi-contract receives the tacit submission of the
parties concerned, there is no reason why it should not be legally
binding as well.</p>

<p>Now the existence of a debt implies that someone must pay it,
and the next question is to determine who that someone ought to be.</p>

<p>Obviously it can only be those who have benefited by the existence
of natural solidarity—all those who have amassed a fortune, but
whose fortune would be still to make but for the co-operation of a
thousand collaborators, both past and present. Such individuals
have already drawn more than their share and have a balance to
make up on the debit account. This debt should certainly be paid.
It is all the better if it is done voluntarily, as an act of liberality
arising out of goodness of heart—<i>quia bonus</i>, as the Gospel narrative
puts it, of the rich good man. But this is hardly probable. Most
people will pay just when they are obliged to; but such people have
no right to consider themselves free, and no claim to the free disposal
of their goods until they have acquitted themselves honourably.<a name="FNanchor_1259" id="FNanchor_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a>
Individual property will be respected and free when every social
debt which it involves has been adequately discharged, and not
before then.<a name="FNanchor_1260" id="FNanchor_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> Until this is done it is useless to speak of the existence
of competition.</p>

<p>The next question is to determine who is to receive payment.
Payment ought to be made to those who, instead of benefiting
by the existence of natural solidarity, have suffered loss
through its operation—the disinherited, as they are rightly called.<a name="FNanchor_1261" id="FNanchor_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a>
All those who have not received a fair share of the total wealth
produced by the co-operation of all naturally find themselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
the position of creditors. It is not easy to name them, perhaps, but
the State can reach them a helping hand in a thousand different
ways. State action of this kind was formerly spoken of as public
assistance; nowadays it is termed solidarity or mutual insurance.</p>

<p>The payment may take the form either of a voluntary contribution
to help some solidarist effort or other, or an obligatory contribution
levied by the State. Some advocate progressive taxation, for
if it be true that profits tend to grow progressively in proportion as
an increase in the variety and strength of the means of production
takes place, why not a progressive tax as well?<a name="FNanchor_1262" id="FNanchor_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> Besides, the tax
would be of a semi-sacred character, because it would mean the
discharging of an important social debt. Nor is there anything
very extravagant in the demand that the State should see that
everyone makes a contribution in proportion to his ability, seeing that
the natural function of the State is to be the guardian of contracts.<a name="FNanchor_1263" id="FNanchor_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a></p>

<p>It is still more difficult to assess the rate of payment. The
conditions under which payment would be made, says M. Bourgeois,
would be such as the associates themselves would have adopted
had they been free to discuss the terms of their engagement. In
other words, everything must be regulated as if society were the
result of an express convention, or rather of a retroactive contract
mutually agreed upon. The difficulty is to determine the conditions
which individual associates would demand as the price of their
adhesion to the terms of the contract. We shall have to imagine
what they would demand were they able to make fresh terms.</p>

<p>But we are not much farther ahead after all, for the individual
himself knows nothing at all about it. Renouncing the attempt to
solve the insoluble, one has to fix some kind of minimum claim which
the disinherited may reasonably expect to see fulfilled. Such a
minimum claim would be a guarantee against the ordinary risks of life.
Society would become a kind of association for mutual insurance,
with the good and bad fortune spread out equally over everybody.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1264" id="FNanchor_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a></p>

<p>But a quasi-contract is something very different from this.
Contracts and quasi-contracts are based upon the giving and receiving
of equivalent values, <i>do ut des</i>, whereas mutual insurance is a kind
of substitute for direct liability. A contract is essentially individualistic—mutualism
is primarily socialistic.</p>

<p>This idea of a quasi-contract contributed not a little to the
success of M. Bourgeois’s theory, but it makes no vital contribution
to the doctrine itself, and he might very easily have omitted
it altogether.<a name="FNanchor_1265" id="FNanchor_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> It is nothing better than an artifice, almost a logomachy,
invented for the express purpose of affording some kind of
justification for demanding a legal contribution by treating it as
an implicit or retroactive contract. It is more of a concession to
individual liberty than anything else. A taxpayer grumbles at a
tax which goes to provide pensions for the old, but it is pointed
out to him that the contribution is owing from him in virtue
not of an explicit agreement perhaps, but at least of a quasi-agreement.</p>

<p>But what useful purpose can be served by such ironical subterfuge?
If it can be shown that owing to inferior moral education
the law must have the making of a conscience for those who have
none, and must enforce a certain minimum of social duties which
appear necessary for the preservation of life and the perpetuation of
social amenities, what is that but a form of State Socialism? If it
is pointed out, on the other hand, that moral progress consists in
transforming debts into duties<a name="FNanchor_1266" id="FNanchor_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a> rather than <i>vice versa</i>, one readily
realises that it is best to multiply the number of free institutions of
a solidarist complexion, such as mutual aid and co-operative societies,
trade unions, etc.</p>

<p>Another objective which the quasi-contract theory had in view
was to supply the debtor with a kind of guarantee that nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
would be required of him beyond the exact equivalent of his debt.<a name="FNanchor_1267" id="FNanchor_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a>
But, as we have already noted, it would be a somewhat illusory
guarantee, because it is almost impossible to determine the amount
of the debt in the first place. Since the amount of this debt is in
some way to be fixed by law it may be well to begin with it.</p>

<p>Should the legislator find himself driven to accept M. Bourgeois’s
valuation, the demands made upon the taxpayer will not be so
exorbitant after all. The whole mass of obligations is summed up
under three heads:</p>

<p>1. Free education for all classes of the community. Intellectual
capital more than any other kind of capital is a collective good, and
should never be other than common property, upon which every
one may draw whenever he wishes. A necessary corollary would
be a shorter working day.</p>

<p>2. A minimum of the means of existence for everybody. It is
difficult to imagine a retroactive contract which refuses to grant
men the right to live. Regarded in this light, the “guarantism” of
Sismondi and Fourier, the “right to work” of Louis Blanc and
Considérant, gain new significance and throb with fresh vitality.</p>

<p>3. Insurance against the risks of life, which, being fortuitous, are
escaped by none. We know the promptness with which the feeling
of kinship is aroused whenever one of these accidents happens on a
scale somewhat larger than usual and assumes the proportions of a
catastrophe. Why should it be otherwise when a single individual
falls a victim to the fickleness of fate?</p>

<p class="tb">If M. Bourgeois has given his theory a distinctly politico-legal
bias, M. Durkheim has taken good care to approach the question
from the standpoint of moralist and sociologist.</p>

<p>M. Durkheim draws a distinction between two kinds of
solidarities.</p>

<p>The first of these, which he regards as a quite inferior type,
depends upon external resemblances, and is of a purely mechanical
character, like the cohesion of atoms in a physical body. The other,
which consists of a union of dissimilars, is the result of division of
labour, and of such is the union between the various members of
the human body. Durkheim regards this kind of unity as of
immense significance, not so much because of its economic consequence
as of its important moral results, “which might even supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
the basis of a new moral order.” Seeing that individuals really
follow divergent paths, the struggle for existence cannot be quite
so keen as it is generally supposed to be,<a name="FNanchor_1268" id="FNanchor_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> and this differentiation
between the individual and the mass enables the former to dissociate
himself from the collective conscience. Durkheim’s desire was to
see the new ethic developed by the professional associations; hence
the important <i>rôle</i> which trade unionism holds in his philosophy.</p>

<p>Without disputing the validity of the distinction thus made, we
may be allowed to question the advisability of treating one kind
of solidarity with such contempt and of showing such enthusiasm
for the other. Our hope is that the future lies with the former kind.
For what is the object of evolution if it is not to make what seems
similar really alike? The world is not merely marching in the
direction of greater differentiation; it is also moving towards a
deeper unity. This seems a well-established fact, at least so far as
the physical world is concerned. Mountains are brought low and
the hollow places filled. Heat is dissipated throughout space,
causing minute gradations of temperature, and the establishment of
a kind of final equilibrium.<a name="FNanchor_1269" id="FNanchor_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> The same law applies to human
beings. Differences of caste, of rank, of manners and customs, of
language and measurements, are everywhere being obliterated. And
it seems by this time a tolerably well-established fact that the
wars of the past were wars between strangers—strangers in race
or religion, in culture or education—and consequently it was
between people who were dissimilar that they appeared most
violent. Therefore the march towards unity also represents a
movement in the direction of peace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1270" id="FNanchor_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a></p>

<p>Such a conception of solidarity seems more akin to the ideal
which we have formed respecting it, and has by far the greatest
moral value; for if I am to be responsible for the evil that has
befallen another, or to be considered an accomplice in the evil
which he has done, that can only be just in proportion to the
extent to which that other is also myself.<a name="FNanchor_1271" id="FNanchor_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> The practical result
will be a preference for such modes of association as will group men
together according to some general characteristic—a co-operative
association rather than a trade union; for while the interest of the
latter is in opposition both to that of the producer and that of the
public, the method of association in the former case is the most
general imaginable, for everyone at some time or other must be
regarded as a consumer.</p>

<h4 id="heading79">III: THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF
SOLIDARIST DOCTRINES<a name="FNanchor_1272" id="FNanchor_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a></h4>

<p>There is no such thing as a Solidarist school in the sense in which
we speak of a Historical, a Liberal, or a Marxian school. Solidarity
is a banner borne aloft by more than one school, and a philosophy that
serves to justify aims that are occasionally divergent. As we have
already had occasion to point out, the solidarists are more of a political
party than a doctrinal school, and their best work has been done in
association with the Radical-Socialist party. Behind them is the State
Socialist or “interventionist” school. It has been suggested that the
social legislation of the last twenty years, such as the regulations
governing the conditions of labour, factory and general hygiene, insurance
against accidents and old age, State aid for the aged and the
disabled,<a name="FNanchor_1273" id="FNanchor_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> the establishment of societies for mutual credit, rural banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
and cheap cottages, and school clinics, all of which are the direct
outcome of preaching solidarity, as well as the grants in aid of these
objects which are paid out of the progressive taxation levied upon
inherited wealth or extraordinary incomes of such as have plucked
the fruit from the tree of civilisation to the deprivation of those
who caused that fruit to grow, should be known as “the laws of
social solidarity.”</p>

<p>Nor are workmen the only class who are likely to benefit by the
adoption of this principle. The Protectionist or Nationalist party
claims to be the party of solidarity, as well as the mutualists, who
employ the term oftener than anyone else. When the taxpayer
complains about the taxes which he has to pay in order to grant a
bounty to certain proprietors or manufacturers, and the consumer
grumbles because the levying of import duties results in increasing
his cost of living, the reply is that the spirit of solidarity demands
that preference should be given to their own kith and kin.<a name="FNanchor_1274" id="FNanchor_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a></p>

<p>Fiscal reform, with its twofold attribute of a progressive tax at
one end of the scale and total exemption at the other, also claims to
be solidarist. Progressive taxation is justified on the ground that
those who have made their fortunes are the debtors of society,
while exemption at the other end is only fair, seeing that the disinherited
have nothing to give, but have already a strong claim
upon society.</p>

<p>However closely akin to State Socialism practical solidarism may
appear, the fact that the latter may achieve its results merely by
means of associationism is sufficient to distinguish it from the
former. The result is that it has given quite a fresh impetus to the
associative movement. Syndicalists, mutualists, and co-operators
vie with one another in their anxiety to swear allegiance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
principle of free solidarism as distinct from the forced solidarism of
the State Socialists.<a name="FNanchor_1275" id="FNanchor_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> It is not that they fail to recognise the necessity
for the latter and its superiority over free competition, but on
moral grounds they think that such forced solidarism is even inferior
to competition. It is imperative, however, that we should make
some distinction between such heterogeneous elements as enter into
the composition of the solidarist party.</p>

<p>The syndicalists, who come first, will hear of nothing except
trade unionism, which is to become the basis of a new economic
organisation and a new kind of ethics. The sense of solidarity is in
this case very strong, because the <i>syndicat</i> poses as the sworn
foe of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. Nothing develops this sense like a struggle,
and the struggle becomes a means of discipline. The attempts made
by the trade unionists to enforce this solidarity, not only upon their
own members, but also upon workmen who are unwilling to enrol
themselves as members of the union, the antagonism shown for
the <i>jaunes</i>, and the advent of the solidarist or sympathetic strike,
constitute one of the most interesting aspects of the syndicalist
movement.</p>

<p>Next came the mutualists, who are loudest and most persistent
in their appeal to solidarity.<a name="FNanchor_1276" id="FNanchor_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> It is not difficult to understand this
when we realise the battle which they wage against the ills of
life—invalidity, old age, poverty, and death. It is just here that
men most feel the need of sticking together. But if we are to judge
by the sacrifices which they make, the sense of solidarity among
the mutualists themselves is not very great. They are loud in
their demands that the State or the commune, or even voluntary
subscribers, should complete what they have begun,<a name="FNanchor_1277" id="FNanchor_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
State should delegate to them the task of establishing workmen’s
pensions and of dispensing State aid. Containing as they do some
members of the middle classes as well as employees, they show no
pronounced revolutionary leanings, nor have they even a plan of
social reorganisation.</p>

<p>Co-operation, on account of its scope and the variety of its
aims, has some claim to be regarded as in a measure a realisation
of the ideals of solidarism. But co-operation presents a twofold
aspect with different programmes and aims that are not always
easily reconcilable. The oldest movements in which the fraternal
tradition of 1848 may still be viewed in all its pristine vigour are the
producers’ associations, of which we have already spoken. Their
ideal is to emancipate the worker by setting up a kind of
industrial republic, and they make a practical beginning with
“guarantism,” which Sismondi expected the masters to give and
which Fourier thought would naturally follow the establishment
of the Phalanstère.<a name="FNanchor_1278" id="FNanchor_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> But however rosy the prospects may be they
can never affect more than a very small proportion of the working
classes.</p>

<p>Distributive societies have met with a greater measure of success.
Their membership is reckoned by the million, and in some towns in
England, Germany, and Switzerland the members actually comprise
the majority of the population. Such is the colossal magnitude of the
“wholesale” that it might even alter the whole character of commercial
organisation—that is, if we are to judge not merely by the
record of its transactions, but also by the feeling of awe which it
inspires in the minds of merchants in all countries, who are already
claiming the protection of their respective Governments. Although
the number of such societies is rapidly increasing in France, they
have never had quite the same practical influence there, simply
because they have been lacking in the true spirit of solidarity.
Curiously enough, these French co-operators have formulated a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
most ambitious programme of social reform, which is wholly inspired
by the experience of the Rochdale Pioneers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1279" id="FNanchor_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a></p>

<p>The gospel of solidarity has even penetrated into the rural
districts, and although the temperament of the peasant is strongly
individualistic it is already beginning to bear fruit in the shape of
numerous associations of various kinds. The most interesting of
these is the mutual credit society, which implies collective responsibility
for social debts.<a name="FNanchor_1280" id="FNanchor_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a></p>

<p>This by no means exhausts the practical consequences of the
solidarist ideal. One notable result which has already shown itself
is a serious modification of the whole conception of the rights and
attributes of private property. The old formula in which property
was spoken of as a social trust rather than as a strictly individualistic
right at the <i>dominium ex jure Quiritium</i>, but which until quite
recently was nothing more than a mere metaphor, becomes a reality
under the inspiration of this new doctrine of solidarity. Once it is
realised that property is simply the result of the unconscious co-operation
of a large number of causes, most of which are impersonal,
the tendency will be to eliminate it altogether or to adapt it more
and more to collective ends. M. Alfred Fouillée,<a name="FNanchor_1281" id="FNanchor_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> a French philosopher,
aptly put this aspect of the question when he spoke of social
co-proprietorship being grafted on to individual property.</p>

<p>The modifications introduced into the study of jurisprudence
by emphasising its solidarist aspect are occasionally spoken of as
“juridical socialism,” a term that is not very clear, to say the least.
The jurists who have undertaken the task of applying this new
principle to the study of jurisprudence have not merely adopted the
quasi-contract theory as the basis of their work of reconstruction,
but have also refused to recognise any absolute rights of property;
in other words, they claim that the proprietor has other responsibilities
besides the mere exercise of those rights (<i>qui suo jure utitur
neminem lædere videtur</i>).</p>

<p>Instead of emphasising the new principle known as the “abuse of
rights,” they prefer to claim the complete subjection of all private
rights to the public weal. They point to a thousand instances in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
which a proprietor ought to be held responsible, though through no
fault of his own, for the results following from the discharge of his
economic duties.<a name="FNanchor_1282" id="FNanchor_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> The existence of such a thing as an acquired
right is also denied, chiefly on the ground that fictitious rights of
this kind bar the way to progress by setting up a claim for indemnity.<a name="FNanchor_1283" id="FNanchor_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading80">IV: CRITICISM</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding the popularity of the term “solidarity” and the
numerous attempts made to give effect to the doctrine of which we
have just given a summary account, it would be a mistake to
imagine that the theory has met with sympathy everywhere. On
the contrary, it has been subjected to the liveliest criticism, especially
by the Liberal economists.</p>

<p>It is not that the Liberals deny the existence of solidarity or
disapprove of the results which follow from its operation. The
discovery of the law of solidarity under the familiar aspect of
division of labour and exchange constitutes a part of their own
title to fame, and extravagant were the eulogiums which they
bestowed upon its working.</p>

<p>They do, however, hold firmly to the belief that economic
solidarity is quite sufficient, and that it is also the best imaginable,
despite the fact that it may be our duty to organise it afresh. Is it
possible to improve upon a system of division of functions which
gives everyone, every day of his life, the equivalent of the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
which he has rendered to society? Bastiat in his fable <i>The Blind
and the Paralytic</i> compares this distribution of social effort to an
understanding between two such persons, whereby the blind does
the walking and the maimed indicates the direction.</p>

<p>Members of this school are strongly of the opinion that it is
quite enough to let this principle of each for all work itself out
under the pressure of competition. And as a matter of fact is it
not to the interest of the producer to consult the wants and tastes
and even the fancies of the public? Altruism pursued in this spirit,
as it well might be, manifests itself as an incessant desire to satisfy
the wants of others, and even to live for others. It loses none of
its force by becoming, instead of a mere ideal, a professional necessity
which no producer can afford to neglect without running the risk
of failure.<a name="FNanchor_1284" id="FNanchor_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> And it is not only between producers and consumers,
but also between capital and labour, that such solidarity exists.
Neither can produce without the other, and the interest of both
is to have as large a produce as possible. A similar kind of solidarity
exists among nations. The richer our neighbours are the better
chance of our finding an outlet for our products.</p>

<p>Moreover, none of these <i>solidarités</i> but is essentially just, since
everyone receives the exact equivalent of what he gives. What
can the new doctrine of solidarity add to this, unless it be, perhaps,
an element of pure parasitism?<a name="FNanchor_1285" id="FNanchor_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a></p>

<p>For what is the essence of the new doctrine if it is not that those
members of society who are possessed of a certain superiority
of position, either material or intellectual (which is very often the
result of the greater contribution which they have made to the
material or intellectual capital of society), by a bold inversion of
their material positions should find themselves treated as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
debtors of such as have not succeeded? The natural result is that
there are springing up everywhere in society whole classes who are
living upon the claims of solidarity, just as their predecessors lived
upon the claims of Christian charity. More daring than their forbears,
they have none of the humility of the ordinary beggar, but
boldly demand their due; not for the love of God, as was wont
with the true mendicant, but in the name of some quasi-contract,
with a policeman within hailing distance lest the debtor should not
acquit himself in a sufficiently graceful fashion. Hence the swarm
of pensioners and semi-invalids, of unemployed who patronise the
relief works, and of victims of accidents more or less real, of
parents who have their children reared for nothing, of manufacturers
and proprietors who make a profit directly or indirectly out of the
existence of public rights, and of public servants who in the name
of professional solidarity trample national solidarity underfoot and
sacrifice the interests both of taxpayer and consumer.</p>

<p>The economists have never held the doctrine that commutative
justice by itself—mere <i>do ut des</i>—is enough. Adjacent to the realm
of justice lies the domain of charity. But to annex this zone to the
dominion of justice and to claim solidarity as a justification seems
utter futility.</p>

<p>There is no avoiding this dilemma. Either they get the equivalent
of what they give, which is the case under a system of free
exchange, or they do not—in which case they must be either getting
more or less. In other words, they are either parasites or destitutes—a
case of exploitation or of charity.</p>

<p>It is further pointed out that the whole trend of evolution appears
to give no countenance to this doctrine of solidarity, and that
consequently it is of the nature of a retrograde movement. Even
in the biological realm we come across what looks like a persistent
effort to attain independence or autonomy, a struggle on the part
of the individual to free himself from the trammels of his descent.<a name="FNanchor_1286" id="FNanchor_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a>
Such must be the explanation of the recent heroic efforts to leave
the earth and rise towards the skies, and the consequent exultation
which the aviator feels when he finds that he has overcome the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
force of gravity and broken the last link which bound man to his
mother earth. Turning to criminal law, we are met with similar
considerations there. The collective responsibility of the whole
family or tribe seemed quite just to the primitive mind, and the sons
of the Atridæ and the descendants of Adam suffered with hardly a
murmur for the sins committed by their parents.<a name="FNanchor_1287" id="FNanchor_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> But to us the
doctrine is simply revolting. Whenever such penalties are demanded
by nature we can only submit with the best grace that we can
command. We are reluctantly bound to admit that the innocent
does suffer for the faults of others—that the child perishes because
the parent was a drunkard. But we, at any rate, regard such things
as evil, and valiantly struggle against them. We are not much
given to raising altars to Eumenides. When solidarity breeds
contamination we seek to counteract it by a strict individualism
that immunes. The innumerable fetters that had been riveted
together by the old co-operative <i>régime</i> were ruthlessly torn off by
the French Revolution. Why attempt to forge new chains by
giving to each individual a hypothetical claim upon his fellows?</p>

<p>The moralists in their turn have also raised objections. They
want to know what new principle of morality solidarity professes to
teach. When it has been shown that my neighbour’s illness may easily
compass my own death, what new feeling will the mere proving of
this beget in me? Will it be love? Is it not much more likely to
reveal itself as a desire to keep him as far from me as possible—to
get rid of him altogether like a plague-stricken rat, or at least to
see that he is locked up in some sanatorium or other? I may
perhaps be found more willing to contribute towards the upkeep
of the sanatorium, but the dominant motive will be fear, or self-interest,
if that word seems preferable.<a name="FNanchor_1288" id="FNanchor_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a></p>

<p>Thus solidarity, while it does not seem to contain any new
doctrine of love, tends to weaken and to suppress the sense of
responsibility by treating society as a whole, or at least the
social environment, as the source of our errors, our vices and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
crimes. Individual responsibility, however, is the very basis of
morality.</p>

<p>Such are the criticisms preferred by individualist economists. It
would be a mistake to imagine, however, that the socialists, the
anarchists, or the syndicalists have treated the doctrine with any
greater degree of indulgence. The proposal to reconcile masters and
workmen, rich and poor, in a kind of silly, sentimental embrace is a
menace to socialism and a denial of the principle of class war.<a name="FNanchor_1289" id="FNanchor_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a></p>

<p>All such criticism, however, utterly fails to convince us. It may
be well, perhaps, to get rid of the coercive element in the discharge
of social debt, but that does not do away with the valuable contribution
made by solidarity both to social economics and to ethics.</p>

<p>Solidarity by itself does not furnish a principle of moral conduct,
since it is just a natural fact, and as such it is non-moral. Whenever
we imagine that solidarity is something evil, that judgment in
itself is a proof that we have had recourse to some criterion
outside solidarity itself by which to judge of its good or evil features.
It is quite possible also that the idea may be exploited for the profit
of the egoist. If solidarity is nothing but a mere cord binding us
together it may quite possibly happen that it will be used to exalt
some people and to pull others down, and the number brought low
may even exceed the number raised up. We need not be surprised
if occasionally we find that instead of increasing the power of
good we have extended the opportunity for evil. But we must
speed the coming of these new powers in the hope that in the end
good will triumph over evil. Solidarity by itself cannot furnish a
rule of moral conduct to such as have none already; but, granting
the existence of a moral principle, it matters not whether it be
egoism or altruism, solidarity supplies us with a leverage of incomparable
strength.</p>

<p>In short, it teaches us three important lessons:</p>

<p>1. It shows us that all the good which has happened to others
has added to our own well-being, and that all the evil that has
befallen them has done us harm, and that consequently we ought
to encourage the one and discourage the other, so that a policy of
indifferent abstention is no longer possible for any of us.</p>

<p>The mode of action prescribed may be frankly utilitarian, but
there is an element of triumph in getting the egoist to forget himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
and to remember others, even though it be but for a time. A heart
that beats for others, though the reason perhaps be selfish, is a
somewhat nobler heart. It is doubtful whether we can ever get
pure altruism without some admixture of self-interest. The Gospel
only asks that we should love our neighbour as ourselves. Solidarity
makes a similar demand, neither more nor less, but undertakes to
prove that the neighbour is really myself.</p>

<p>2. It shows us how the results of our actions return upon
ourselves with their harvest of suffering or joy a thousand times
increased. This gives it its character for solemnity and majesty
which has made it such an exceedingly favourable instrument for
moral education. To our care is entrusted the welfare of souls,
and just as we are led to see that we never really had a right to say
that this or that matter was no concern of ours, so we also find
ourselves relieved of that other equally heinous maxim, namely,
that certain matters concern ourselves alone. Far from weakening
the sense of responsibility, as some writers maintain, it is obvious
that it increases it indefinitely.</p>

<p>3. It is true that in a contrary fashion it renders us more indulgent
of the faults of others, by showing how often we have been unconscious
accomplices in their crime. Morally this is a gain, for it helps us
to be more indulgent towards others, but more severe upon ourselves.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of sociological evolution we are confronted
with the dissolution of many of the older forms of solidarity and
with the emergence of new ones. What really takes place is an
extension of the circle of solidarity through the family, the city, and
the nation until it reaches humanity—such expansion being accompanied
by a doubly fortunate result. On the one hand corporate
egoism becomes so ennobled and extended that it includes the
whole of humanity, with the result that the strife between antagonistic
interests becomes less acute. The old argument from
independence had already grown blunt in the struggle with division
of labour. Degree of independence is not the sole measure of
personality. The savage beneath his ancestral tree is independent,
and so perhaps is Ibsen’s hero in revolt against society. The king
on his throne, on the other hand, who never speaks except in the
plural number, is always conscious of his dependence. But the
savage because of his independence is powerless, whereas the king
because of his dependence is very powerful. Solidarity, whether it
be like the rope that binds the Alpine climber to his guide which
may lead them both to the abyss, or like the patriotism that
rivets the soldier’s gaze upon his country’s flag, cannot detract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
from individuality. If it be true, as was said just now, that the
crystal is the earliest effort of the individual to render itself independent
of its environment, we must never forget that it is also the
earliest realisation of true solidarity in the form of association.</p>

<p>As to the argument of the economists that mere exchange is the
only form of solidarity that is at all compatible with the demands
of justice, all the schools whose fortunes we have followed in the
course of this volume have declared against this view, not excepting
even the Mathematical school, the latest offspring of the Classical
tradition. Esau’s bargain with Jacob, the contracts between the
Congo Company and the blacks, or between the <i>entrepreneur</i> and the
home-worker, are irreproachable from a Hedonistic standpoint (see
<a href="#Page_540">p. 540</a>). But no one would consider such primitive exchanges, which,
as Proudhon eloquently remarks, savour of retaliation—an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth—as evidence of the existence of solidarity.</p>

<p>Even if we conceived of exchange as a balance the two sides of
which are in equilibrium, it is impossible to escape the conclusion
that the contracting parties fare rather differently when they do
not start on a footing of complete equality. There is always a
Brennus ready to throw his sword into the scales.</p>

<p>It is only natural that we should ask ourselves what is to be
done under such circumstances. Must we be content simply to resign
ourselves to our fate? This seems inevitable if it be true, as the
economists seem to suggest, that human relations depend entirely
upon exchange and its derivatives—selling, lending, wage-earning,
etc. But it is quite otherwise when these human relations are
regarded as the outcome of association, whether professional,
mutualist, or co-operative.<a name="FNanchor_1290" id="FNanchor_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a></p>

<p>In this spirit the worker subscribes to his union with a view to
increasing its strength. Undoubtedly he reckons upon getting a
higher wage, but there is no necessary relation between his membership
of the union and the eventual rise in wages which he expects.
The mutualist supports his society in the hope that he may add to
the general feeling of security. Undoubtedly in his case again he
reckons upon the society paying his doctor should he fall ill, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
scores of members pass through life without making any demand
upon their society at all, contributing much more than they withdraw.
In this way the good lives pay for the bad ones. The
member of the co-operative society, in a similar fashion, is more
concerned about a fuller satisfaction of his need than he is about
the amount of profit that he can get out of it. In short, whereas
under a competitive system each one tries to get rid of his neighbour,
under a <i>régime</i> of association everyone would try to make some use
of him. The object of solidarity is to substitute “each for all” as
a principle of action instead of “each for himself.”<a name="FNanchor_1291" id="FNanchor_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> Every step
taken in this direction, whether we wish it or no, implies a movement
away from the <i>régime</i> of exchange in the direction of solidarity.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV_THE_ANARCHISTS">CHAPTER IV: THE ANARCHISTS</h3>

<p>The social creed of the anarchist is a curious fusion of Liberal
and socialist doctrines. Its economic criticism of the State, its
enthusiasm for individual initiative, as well as its conception of a
spontaneous economic order, are features which it owes to Liberalism;
while its hatred of private property and its theory of exploitation
represent its borrowings from socialism.</p>

<p>Doctrinal fusions of this kind which seek to combine two extreme
standpoints not infrequently outdo them both. Dunoyer, for
example, was the extremest of Liberals, but he took great care to
remind his readers of at least one function which none but the State
could perform: no other authority, he thought, could ever undertake
to provide security. True <i>bourgeois</i> of 1830 that he was,
Dunoyer always considered that “order” was a prime social
necessity.<a name="FNanchor_1292" id="FNanchor_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> But, armed with the criticism of the socialists, the
anarchists soon get rid of this last vestige of the State’s prerogative.
In their opinion the security of which Dunoyer spoke merely meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
the security of proprietors; “order” is only necessary for the
defence of the possessors against the attack of the non-possessors.
The socialists themselves (with the exception of Fourier, perhaps,
whom the anarchists claim as one of themselves), however opposed
to private property, were exceedingly anxious to retain considerable
powers in the hands of the State, such as the superintendence of
social production, for example. Armed this time with the criticism
of the Liberal school, the anarchists experience no difficulty in
demonstrating the economic and administrative incapacity of the
State. “Liberty without socialism means privilege, and socialism
without liberty means slavery and brutality”—so writes Bakunin.<a name="FNanchor_1293" id="FNanchor_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a></p>

<p>It is only fitting that a few pages at the end of this book should
be devoted to a doctrine that attempts to fuse the two great social
currents that strove so valiantly for the upper hand in nineteenth-century
history.</p>

<p>It is not our first acquaintance with anarchy, however. It has
already been given a “local habitation and a name” by Proudhon,
who is the real father of modern anarchism. This does not imply
that similar doctrines may not be discovered in writings of a still
earlier date, as in Godwin’s, for example. But such writers remained
solitary exceptions,<a name="FNanchor_1294" id="FNanchor_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> while the links connecting the anarchical teaching
of Proudhon with the political and social anarchy of the last thirty
years are easily traced. Not only is the similarity of ideas very striking,
but their transmission from Proudhon to Bakunin, and thence to
Kropotkin, Reclus, and Jean Grave, is by no means difficult to
follow.</p>

<p>Alongside of the political and social anarchism which form the
principal subject of this chapter there is also the philosophical
and literary anarchism, whose predominant characteristic is an
almost insane exaltation of the individual. The best known representative
of this school, which hails from Germany, is Max Stirner,
whose book entitled <i>Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum</i> appeared in
1844.<a name="FNanchor_1295" id="FNanchor_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> The work was forgotten for a long time, although it enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
a striking success when it first appeared. Some twenty years ago,
just when Nietzsche was beginning to win that literary renown
which is so unmistakably his to-day, it was seen that in Stirner he
had a precursor, although Stirner’s works probably remained quite
unknown to Nietzsche himself, with the result that Stirner has
since enjoyed posthumous fame as the earliest <i>immoraliste</i>. A few
words only are necessary to show the difference between his doctrines
and those of Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin.<a name="FNanchor_1296" id="FNanchor_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading81">I: STIRNER’S PHILOSOPHICAL ANARCHISM AND THE
CULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL</h4>

<p>Stirner’s book was written as the result of a wager. The nature
of the circumstances and the character of the epoch that gave birth
to it were briefly these. Stirner was a member of a group of young
German Radicals and democrats whom Bruno Bauer had gathered
round him in 1840. They drew their inspiration from Feuerbach,
and accepted the more extreme views of the Hegelian philosophy.
Their ideal was the absolute freedom of the human spirit, and in
the sacred name of liberty they criticised everything that seemed in
any way opposed to this ideal, whether nascent communism,
dogmatic Christianity, or absolute government. The intellectual
leaders of the German Revolution of 1848 were drawn from this
group, but they were soon swept aside in the reaction of 1850. A
few of them who were in the habit of meeting regularly in one of
the Berlin restaurants assumed the name <i>die Freien</i>. Marx and
Engels occasionally joined them, but soon left in disgust. Their
joint pamphlet, which bears the ironical title of <i>The Holy Family</i>,
is supposed to refer to Bauer and his friends. A few of the German
Liberal economists, including Julius Faucher among others, paid
occasional visits to the Hippel Restaurant. Max Stirner, who was
one of the most faithful members and a most attentive listener,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
although it does not seem that he contributed much to the discussion,
conceived the idea of preparing a surprise for his friends in the form
of a book in which he attempted to prove that the criticism of the
supercritics was itself in need of criticism.</p>

<p>The extreme Radicals who formed the majority of the group
were still very strongly attached to a number of abstract ideas
which to Stirner seemed little better than phantoms. Humanity,
Society, the Pure, and the Good seemed so many extravagant
abstractions; so many fetishes made with hands before whom
men bow the knee and show as much reverence as ever the
faithful have shown towards their God. Such abstractions, it
seemed to him, possess about as much reality as the gods of
Olympus or the ghosts that people the imagination of childhood.
The only reality we know is the individual; there is no other. Every
individual constitutes an independent original force, its only law its
own personal interest, and the only limit to his development consists
in whatever threatens that interest or weakens its force. Every
man has a right to say, “I want to become all that it is within my
power to become, and to have everything I am entitled to.”<a name="FNanchor_1297" id="FNanchor_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a>
Bastiat had already expressed it as his opinion that there could
be no conflict of legitimate rights, and Stirner declares that “every
interest is legitimate provided only it is possible.” “The crouching
tiger is within his rights when he springs at me; but so am I when
I resist his attacks.” “Might is right, and there is no right without
might.”<a name="FNanchor_1298" id="FNanchor_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a></p>

<p>Granting that the individual is the only reality, all those collective
unities that go by the name of the family, the State, society, or the
nation, and all of which tend to limit his individuality by making
the individual subservient to themselves, at once become meaningless.
They are devoid of substance and reality.<a name="FNanchor_1299" id="FNanchor_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> Whatever authority
they possess has been ascribed to them by the individual. Mere
creatures of the imagination, they lose every right as soon as I
cease to recognise them, and it is only then that I become a really
free man. “I have a right to overthrow every authority, whether of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
Jesus, Jehovah, or God, if I can. I have a right to commit a murder
if I wish it—that is to say, unless I shun a crime as I would a disease.
I decide the limits of my rights, for outside the ego there is nothing.…
It may be that that nothing belongs to no one else; but
that is somebody else’s affair, not mine. Self-defence is their
own look-out.”<a name="FNanchor_1300" id="FNanchor_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> The workers who complain of exploitation, the
poor who are deprived of all property, have just one thing which they
must do. They must recognise the right to property as inherent in
themselves and take as much of it as they want. “The egoist’s
method of solving the problem of poverty is not to say to the poor,
‘Just wait patiently until a board of guardians shall give you
something in the name of the community,’ but ‘Lay your hands
upon anything you want and take that.’ The earth belongs to him
who knows how to get hold of it, and having got hold of it knows
how to keep it. If he seizes it, not only has he the land, but he has
the right to it as well.”<a name="FNanchor_1301" id="FNanchor_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a></p>

<p>But what kind of a society would we have under such conditions?
It would simply be a “Union of Egos,” each seeking his own
and joining the association merely with a view to greater personal
satisfaction. Present-day society dominates over the individual,
making him its tool. The “Union of Egos”—for we cannot call it a
society—would be simply a tool in the hand of the individual. No
scruples would be felt by anyone leaving the union if he thought something
was to be gained by such withdrawal. Every individual would
just say to his neighbour, “I am not anxious to recognise you or
to show you any respect. I simply want you to be of some service to
me.”<a name="FNanchor_1302" id="FNanchor_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> It would be a case of <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>, with occasional
precarious alliances. But it would at least mean liberty for all.</p>

<p>Such strange, paradoxical doctrines are irrefutable if we accept
Stirner’s postulates. But we must reject his whole point of view
and dispute the stress laid upon the individual as the only reality,
as well as his denial of the reality of society. Granting that the
individual is the only reality, then society and the nation are mere
abstractions created by man and removable at his pleasure. But
that is just the mistake. The individual has no existence apart
from society, nor has he any greater degree of reality. He is simply
an element, not a separate entity. His existence or non-existence
does not depend upon himself. Nor is society merely an idea. It
is a natural fact. The individual may be quite as appropriately
described as an abstraction or a mere phantom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span></p>

<p>The fundamental difference between Stirner and the other
anarchists who will engage our attention is just this recognition of
the reality of the social fact which Stirner denies <i>in toto</i>. It also
marks the cleavage between literary and political anarchism.<a name="FNanchor_1303" id="FNanchor_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading82">II: SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ANARCHISM AND THE
CRITICISM OF AUTHORITY</h4>

<p>Stirner spent his life between his study and the Hippel Restaurant,
the rendezvous of his friends. Bakunin and Kropotkin are men of a
different stamp who have risked their freedom, and even their lives,
for the sake of the cause which they have at heart. It is true that
the seed sown in the mind of the ignorant as the result of their
teaching has often had most deplorable results, but no one can
deny the quality of courage to either Kropotkin or Reclus, or withhold
from them the title of greatness both of mind and character.</p>

<p>Bakunin was reared in much the same intellectual atmosphere
as Stirner.<a name="FNanchor_1304" id="FNanchor_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> By birth he belonged to the Russian nobility, and
spent the earliest years of his life in the Russian army. In 1834, at
the age of twenty, he resigned his commission in order to devote
himself to the study of philosophy, and, like Proudhon, Stirner, and
Marx, he came under the universal spell of Hegel. In 1840 he proceeded
to Berlin, where he became acquainted with the school of
young Radicals of whom we have already spoken. From 1844 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
1847 we find him in Paris, where he used to spend whole nights in
discussion with Proudhon. Proudhon’s influence upon him is very
marked, and one constantly meets with passages in the writings of
the Russian anarchist which are nothing but paraphrases of ideas
already put forward by Proudhon in the <i>Idée générale de la Révolution
au XIXe Siècle</i>. The year 1848 revealed to the dilettante nobleman
his true vocation, which he conceived to be that of a revolutionary.
He successively took part in the risings at Prague and in the Saxon
Revolution at Dresden. He was arrested and twice condemned to
death, in Saxony and again in Austria, but was finally handed over
to the Russian authorities, who imprisoned him in the fortress of St.
Peter and St. Paul, where an attack of scurvy caused him to lose all
his teeth. He was exiled to Siberia in 1857, but managed to escape
in 1861. Making his way to London, he undertook the direction
of a vigorous revolutionary campaign, which was carried on in
Switzerland, Italy, and France. During the years 1870 and 1871 he
successfully planned a popular rising at Lyons. Bernard Lazare
has graphically described him as “a hirsute giant with an enormous
head which seems larger than it really is because of the mass of
bushy hair and untrimmed beard which surrounds it. He always
sleeps rough, has no roof above him, and no homeland which he
can call his own, and like an apostle is always prepared to set out
on his sacred mission at any hour of the night or day.”</p>

<p>The most striking fact in his history was his rupture with Karl
Marx at the last International Congress, held at The Hague in 1872.
Bakunin joined the International in 1869. Disgusted with the
pontifical tendencies of the General Council, which was entirely
under the heel of Marx, he proposed a scheme of federal organisation
under which each section would be left with considerable autonomy.
The Jura Federation supported his proposals, and so did several of
the French, Belgian, and Spanish delegates, as well as all the Italian.
But he was expelled from the International by Marx’s own friends.
The official rupture between Marxian socialism and anarchy, grown
to considerable proportions since, dates from that very moment.
That Hague congress marks also the end of the International. Marx
soon afterwards transferred the centre of the administration to the
United States, and no conference has been held since. Bakunin also
retired from the struggle about the same time, but not before he
had set up a new association at Geneva, composed of a few faithful
friends. In 1876 Bakunin died at Berne.</p>

<p>It was in the region of the Jura, in the neighbourhood of Neuchâtel,
where Bakunin had still a few followers among the extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
individualistic but somewhat mystical population of those parts,
that Kropotkin in the course of a short stay in the district in
1872 imbibed those anarchist ideas to the propagation of which
he has so strenuously devoted his life.<a name="FNanchor_1305" id="FNanchor_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> Although personally unacquainted
with Bakunin, Kropotkin must be regarded as his direct
descendant.</p>

<p>Prince Kropotkin is also a Russian aristocrat, and he, like his
master, joined the army after a short period of study. He attracted
public notice first of all as the author of several remarkable works
dealing with natural history and geography, which showed him
to be a confirmed disciple of Darwin. But science was by no means
his only interest. By 1871 Hegelian influence was on the wane in
Russia, and the more thoughtful of the younger generation turned
their attention to democracy. The new watchword was, “Go, seek
the people, live among them, educate them and win their confidence
if you want to get rid of the yoke of autocracy.” Kropotkin caught
the inspiration. He himself has told us how one evening after
dinner at the Winter Palace he drove off in a cab, took off his fine
clothes, and, putting on a cotton shirt instead of his silk one,
and boots such as the peasants wore, hurried away to another
quarter of the city and joined a number of working men whom he
was trying to educate. But his propaganda proved short-lived, for
one evening when he was leaving the headquarters of the Geographical
Society, where he had just been reading a paper and had been offered
the presidency of one of the sections, he was arrested on a charge of
political conspiracy and imprisoned in the fortress of St. Peter and
St. Paul. He managed to escape in 1876, and found refuge in
England. Afterwards he was wrongfully condemned to three years’
imprisonment at Clairvaux on account of his supposed complicity in
an anarchist outbreak which took place at Lyons in 1884. But
there was something extraordinary about a prisoner who could get
the libraries of Ernest Renan and the Paris Academy of Sciences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
placed at his disposal during his term of imprisonment in order to
enable him to pursue his scientific investigations. During his
previous imprisonment in Russia the Geographical Society of St.
Petersburg had extended him a similar privilege. Kropotkin has
since lived in England.</p>

<p>The best known French anarchists, Élisée Reclus, the geographer,
and Jean Grave, simply reproduce Kropotkin’s ideas, with an
occasional admixture of Bakunin’s or Proudhon’s.<a name="FNanchor_1306" id="FNanchor_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a></p>

<p>Our concern is with the expression of anarchist ideas as we find
them in the best known writers of the school. Consequently we
must pass over the very striking but immature formulæ which are
not infrequently to be met with in the works of more obscure
writers.<a name="FNanchor_1307" id="FNanchor_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a></p>

<p>Here again the distinguishing features are the emphasis laid upon
individual rights and a passion for the free and full development of
personality, which, as we have seen, was the keynote of Stirner’s
system. “Obedience means abdication,” declares Élisée Reclus.<a name="FNanchor_1308" id="FNanchor_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a>
“Mankind’s subjection will continue just so long as it is tolerated.
I am ashamed of my fellow-men,” writes Proudhon in 1850 from his
prison at Doullens.<a name="FNanchor_1309" id="FNanchor_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> “My liberty,” says Bakunin, “or what comes to
the same thing, my honour as a man, consists in obeying no other
individual and in performing only just those acts that carry conviction
to me.”<a name="FNanchor_1310" id="FNanchor_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> Jean Grave declares that society can impose “no
limitations upon the individual save such as are derived from the
natural conditions under which he lives.”<a name="FNanchor_1311" id="FNanchor_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a></p>

<p>But this cult of the individual which is present everywhere in
anarchist literature rests upon a conception which is the direct
antithesis of Stirner’s. To Stirner every man was a unique being
whose will was his only law. The anarchists who follow Proudhon,
on the other hand, regard man as a specimen of humanity, <i>i.e.</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
something superior to the individual. “What I respect in my
neighbour is his manhood,”<a name="FNanchor_1312" id="FNanchor_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> wrote Proudhon. It is this humanity
or manhood that the anarchist would have us respect by respecting
his liberty, for, as Bakunin declares, “liberty is the supreme aim of all
human development.”<a name="FNanchor_1313" id="FNanchor_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> It is not the triumph of the egoist but the
triumph of humanity in the individual that the anarchists would
seek, and so they claim liberty not merely for themselves but for
all men. Far from wishing to be served by their fellow-men, as
Stirner desired, they want equal respect shown for human dignity
wherever found. “Treat others as you would that others should
treat you under similar circumstances,”<a name="FNanchor_1314" id="FNanchor_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> writes Kropotkin, employing
Kantian and even Christian phraseology. Bakunin, a faithful
disciple of Proudhon’s, considered that “all morality is founded on
human respect, that is to say, upon the recognition of the humanity, of
the human rights and worth in all men, of whatever race or colour,
degree of intellectual or moral development”;<a name="FNanchor_1315" id="FNanchor_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> and he adds that “the
individual can only become free when every other individual is free.
Liberty is not an isolated fact. It is the outcome of mutual goodwill;
a principle not of exclusion, but of inclusion, the liberty of each
individual being simply the reflection of his humanity or of his
rights as a human being in the conscience of every free man, his
brother and equal.”<a name="FNanchor_1316" id="FNanchor_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> This idea of humanity, which the latest
anarchists owe to Proudhon, is not simply foreign to Stirner, but is
just one of those phantoms which Stirner was particularly anxious
to waylay.<a name="FNanchor_1317" id="FNanchor_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a></p>

<p>Along with this extravagant worship of individual liberty goes
a hatred of all authority. Here the political anarchists join hands
with Stirner. For the exercise of authority of one man over another
means the exploitation of one man by another and a denial of his
humanity. The State is the summation of all authority, and the
full force of anarchist hatred is focused upon the State. No human
relation is too sacred for State intervention, no citizen but is liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
to have his conduct minutely prescribed by law. There are officers
to apply the law, armies to enforce it, lecturers to interpret it, priests
to inculcate respect for it, and jurists to expound it and to justify
everybody. Thus has the State become the agent <i>par excellence</i> of
all exploitation and oppression.<a name="FNanchor_1318" id="FNanchor_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> It is the <i>one</i> adversary, in the
opinion of every anarchist—“the sum total of all that negates the
liberty of its members.” “It is the grave where every trace of
individuality is sacrificed and buried.” Elsewhere, “it is a flagrant
negation of humanity.”<a name="FNanchor_1319" id="FNanchor_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> Bakunin, who in this matter as well as
in many others is a follower of Bastiat, speaks of it as “the visible
incarnation of infuriated force.” That is enough to label it for ever
with the evil things of life, for the aim of humanity is liberty, but
force is “a permanent negation of liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_1320" id="FNanchor_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a></p>

<p>A necessary agent of oppression, government always and inevitably
becomes the agent of corruption. It contaminates everything
that comes into contact with it, and the first to show signs
of such contamination are its own representatives. “The best man,
whoever that may be, whatever degree of intelligence, magnanimity,
and purity of heart he may have, is unavoidably corrupted by his
trade. The person who enjoys any privilege, whether political or
economic, is intellectually and morally a depraved character.” So
Bakunin thought,<a name="FNanchor_1321" id="FNanchor_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> and Elisée Reclus writes in a similar strain.
“Every tree in nature bears its own peculiar fruit, and government,
whatever be the form it take, always results in caprice or tyranny,
in misery, villainy, murder, and evil.”<a name="FNanchor_1322" id="FNanchor_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> The governing classes are
inevitably demoralised, but so are the governed, and for just the
same reasons. Government is a worker of evil even when it would
do good, for “the good whenever it is enjoined becomes evil.
Liberty, morality, real human dignity consists in this, that man
should do what is good not because he is told to do it, but simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
because he thinks that it really is the best that he can ever wish
or desire.”<a name="FNanchor_1323" id="FNanchor_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a></p>

<p>It matters little what form government takes. Absolute or
constitutional monarchy, democratic or aristocratic republicanism,
government on the basis of a universal or a restricted suffrage, are
all much the same, for they all presuppose a State of some sort.
Authority, whether of a despot or of the majority of the community,
is none the less authority, and implies the exercise of a will other
than the individual’s own. The great error committed by all the
revolutions of the past has been this: one government has been
turned out, but only to have its place usurped by another. The only
true revolution will be that which will get rid of government itself—the
fount and origin of all authority.</p>

<p>Still closer scrutiny reveals the interesting fact that the State,
which is naturally oppressive, gradually becomes employed as the
instrument for the subjugation of the weak by the strong, the poor
by the rich. It was Adam Smith who ventured to declare that
“civil government … is in reality instituted for the defence of
the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against
those who have none at all.”<a name="FNanchor_1324" id="FNanchor_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> Pages of anarchist literature simply
consist of elaborate paraphrases of this remark of Smith’s.</p>

<p>Kropotkin thinks that every law must belong to one or other of
three categories. To the first category belong all laws concerned
with the security of the individual; to the second all laws concerned
with the protection of government; and to the third all
those enactments where the chief object in view is the inviolability
of private property.<a name="FNanchor_1325" id="FNanchor_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> In the opinion of the anarchist, all laws might
more correctly be placed under the last category only, for whenever
the safety of the individual is in any way threatened it is
generally the result of some inequality of fortune.<a name="FNanchor_1326" id="FNanchor_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> Indirectly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
that is to say, the attack is directed against property. The real
function of government is to defend property, and every law which
is instrumental in protecting property is also effective in shielding
the institution of government from attack.</p>

<p>Property itself is an organisation which enables a small minority
of proprietors to exploit and to hold in perpetual slavery the masses
of the people. In this instance the anarchists have not made any
weighty contribution of their own, but have merely adopted the
criticisms of the socialists.<a name="FNanchor_1327" id="FNanchor_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> Proceeding in the usual fashion, they
point to the miserable wages which are usually paid to the workers,
and show how the masters always manage to reserve all the leisure,
all the joys of existence, all the culture and other benefits of civilisation
for themselves. Private property is of the essence of privilege—the
parent of every other kind of privilege. And the State becomes
simply the bulwark of privilege. “Exploitation and government,”
says Bakunin, “are correlative terms indispensable to political life
of every kind. Exploitation supplies the means as well as the
foundation upon which government is raised, and the aim which it
follows, which is merely to legalise and defend further exploitation.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1328" id="FNanchor_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a>
“Experience teaches us,” says Proudhon,<a name="FNanchor_1329" id="FNanchor_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> “that government
everywhere, however popular at first, has always been on the side
of the rich and the educated as against the poor and ignorant
masses.”<a name="FNanchor_1330" id="FNanchor_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a></p>

<p>Whether the extinction of private property, which would free the
worker from the danger of being exploited by the rich, would also
render the State unnecessary is a question upon which the anarchists
are not agreed. Proudhon, we remember, had hoped by means of
the Exchange Bank to reduce the right of property to mere
possession. Bakunin, on the contrary, is under the spell of the
Marxians, and, like a true collectivist, he thinks that all the instruments
of production, including land, should be possessed by the
community. Such instruments should always be at the disposal
of groups of working men expert in the details of agriculture or
industrial production, and such workers should be paid according
to their labour.<a name="FNanchor_1331" id="FNanchor_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> Kropotkin, on the other hand, regards communism
as the ideal and looks upon the distinction drawn by the collectivist
between instruments of production and objects of consumption as
utterly futile. Food, clothing, and fuel are quite as necessary
for production as machinery or tools, and nothing is gained by
emphasising the distinction between them. Social resources of every
kind should be freely placed at the disposal of the workers.<a name="FNanchor_1332" id="FNanchor_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a></p>

<p>But the State and the institution of private property by no
means exhausts the list of tyrannies. Individual liberty is as little
compatible with irrevocable vows—that is, with a present promise
which binds for ever the will of man—as it is with submission to
external authority. The present marriage law, for example, violates
both these conditions. Marriage ought to be a free union. A contract
freely entered upon and deliberately fulfilled is the only form of
marriage that is compatible with the true dignity and equality of
both man and woman.<a name="FNanchor_1333" id="FNanchor_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> A free and not a legal contract is the only
form of engagement which the anarchists recognise. Free contract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
between man and wife, between an individual and an association,
between different associations pursuing the same task, between one
commune and another, or between a commune and a whole country.
But such engagements must always be revocable, otherwise they
would merely constitute another link in the chain that has shackled
humanity. Every contract that is not voluntarily and frequently
renewed becomes tyrannical and oppressive and constitutes a standing
menace to human liberty. “Because I was a fool yesterday,
must I remain one all my life?”<a name="FNanchor_1334" id="FNanchor_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> asks Stirner; and on this point
Bakunin, Kropotkin, Reclus, Jean Grave, and even Proudhon are
agreed.</p>

<p>To regard their social philosophy as nothing but pure caprice
because of the wonderful faith which they had in their fellow-men
would, however, be a great mistake.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the merciless criticism of authority of every
kind, there was still left one autocrat, of a purely abstract character
perhaps, but none the less imperious in its demands. This was
the authority of reason or of science. The sovereignty of reason was
one of the essential features of Proudhon’s anarchist society.<a name="FNanchor_1335" id="FNanchor_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> What
Proudhon calls reason Bakunin refers to as science, but his obeisance
is not a whit less devotional. “We recognise,” says he, “the
absolute authority of science and the futility of contending with
natural law. No liberty is possible for man unless he recognise
this and seek to turn this law to his own advantage. No one except
a fool or a theologian, or perhaps a metaphysician, a jurist, or a
<i>bourgeois</i> economist, would revolt against the mathematical law
which declares that 2 + 2 = 4.” The utmost that a man can
claim in this matter is that “he obeys the laws of nature because he
himself has come to regard them as necessary, and not because they
have been imposed upon him by some external authority.”<a name="FNanchor_1336" id="FNanchor_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a></p>

<p>Not only does Bakunin bow the knee to science, but he also
swears allegiance to technical or scientific skill. “In the matter of
boots I am willing to accept the authority of the shoemaker; of
clothes, the opinion of the tailor; if it is a house, a canal, or a railway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
I consult the architect and the engineer. What I respect is not
their office but their science, not the man but his knowledge. I
cannot, however, allow any one of them to impose upon me, be he
shoemaker, tailor, architect, or savant. I listen to them willingly
and with all the respect which their intelligence, character, or
knowledge deserves, but always reserving my undisputed right of
criticism and control.”<a name="FNanchor_1337" id="FNanchor_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> Bakunin has no doubt that most men
willingly and spontaneously acknowledge the natural authority of
science. He agrees with Descartes and employs almost identical
terms<a name="FNanchor_1338" id="FNanchor_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> when he declares that “common sense is one of the commonest
things in the world.” But common sense simply means
“the totality of the generally recognised laws of nature.” He shares
with the Physiocrats a belief in their obviousness, and invokes their
authority whenever he makes a vow. He is also anxious to make
them known and acceptable of all men through the instrumentality
of a general system of popular education. The moment they are
accepted by “the universal conscience of mankind the question of
liberty will be completely solved.”<a name="FNanchor_1339" id="FNanchor_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> Let us again note how redolent
all this is of the rationalistic optimism of the eighteenth century,
and how closely Liberals and anarchists resemble one another in
their absolute faith in the “sweet reasonableness” of mankind.
Bakunin only differs from the Physiocrats in his hatred of the despot
whom they had enthroned.</p>

<p>A society of free men, perfectly autonomous, each obeying only
himself, but subservient to the authority of reason and science—such
is the ideal which the anarchists propose, a preliminary consideration
of its realisation being the overthrow of every established
authority. “No God and no master,” says Jean Grave; “everyone
obeying his own will.”<a name="FNanchor_1340" id="FNanchor_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading83">III: MUTUAL AID AND THE
ANARCHIST CONCEPTION OF SOCIETY</h4>

<p>At first sight it might seem that a conception of social existence
which would raise every individual on a pedestal and proclaim the
complete autonomy of each would speedily reduce society to a
number of independent personalities. Every social tie removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
there would remain just a few individuals in juxtaposition, and
society as a “collective being” would disappear.</p>

<p>But it would be a grievous mistake to conceive of the anarchist
ideal in this light. There is no social doctrine where the words
“solidarity” and “fraternity” more frequently recur. Individual
happiness and social well-being are to them inseparable. Hobbes’
society, or Stirner’s, where the hand of everyone is against his
brother, fill the anarchists with horror. To their mind that is a
faithful picture of society as it exists to-day. In reality, however,
man is a social being. The individual and society are
correlative: it is impossible to imagine the one without thinking of
the other.</p>

<p>No one has given more forcible expression to this truth than
Bakunin; and this is possibly because no one ever had a keener
sense of social solidarity. “Let us do justice once for all,” he remarks,
“to the isolated or absolute individual of the idealists. But that
individual is as much a fiction as that other Absolute—God.…
Society, however, is prior to the individual, and will doubtless survive
him, just as Nature will. Society, like Nature, is eternal; born of
the womb of Nature, it will last as long as Nature herself.…
Man becomes human and develops a conscience only when he realises
his humanity in society; and even then he can only express himself
through the collective action of society. Man can only be freed
from the yoke of external nature through the collective or social
effort of his fellow-men, who during their sojourn here have transformed
the surface of the earth and made the further development
of mankind possible. But freedom from the yoke of his own nature,
from the tyranny of his own instincts, is only possible when the
bodily senses are controlled by a well-trained, well-educated mind.
Education and training are essentially social functions. Outside the
bounds of society, man would for ever remain a savage beast.”<a name="FNanchor_1341" id="FNanchor_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a></p>

<p>Whether we read Proudhon or Kropotkin, we always meet with
the same emphasis on the reality of the social being, on the pre-existence
of the State, or at least of its necessary coexistence, if the
individual is ever to reach full development. It is true that there
are a few anarchists, such as Jean Grave, who still seem to uphold
the old futile distinction between the individual and society, and
who conceive of society as made up of individuals just as a house is
built of bricks.</p>

<p>But is there no element of contradiction between this idea
and the previous declaration of individual autonomy? How is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
possible to exalt social life and at the same time demand the abolition
of all traditional social links?<a name="FNanchor_1342" id="FNanchor_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a></p>

<p>The apparent antinomy is resolved by emphasising a distinction
which Liberalism had drawn between government and society.
Society is the natural, spontaneous expression of social life. Government
is an artificial organ, or, to change the metaphor, a parasite
preying upon society.<a name="FNanchor_1343" id="FNanchor_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> Liberals from the days of Smith onward
had applied the distinction to economic institutions; the anarchists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
were to apply it to every social institution. Not only the economic
but every form of social life is the outcome of the social instinct
which lies deep in the nature of humanity. This instinct of solidarity
urges men to seek the help of their fellow-men and to act in concert
with them. It is what Kropotkin calls mutual aid, and seems as
natural to man and as necessary for the preservation of the species
as the struggle for existence itself. What really binds society
together, what makes for real cohesion, is not constraint (which,
contrary to the time-honoured belief of the privileged classes, is really
only necessary to uphold their privileges), but this profound instinct
of mutual help and reciprocal friendship, whose strength and force
have never yet been adequately realised. “There is in human
nature,” says Kropotkin, “a nucleus of social habits inherited from
the past, which have not been as fully appreciated as they might. They
are not the result of any restraint and transcend all compulsion.”<a name="FNanchor_1344" id="FNanchor_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a></p>

<p>Law, instead of creating the social instinct, simply presupposes
it. Laws can only be applied so long as the instinct exists, and
fall into desuetude as soon as the instinct refuses to sanction them.
Government, far from developing this instinct, opposes it with rigid,
stereotyped institutions which thwart its full and complete development.
To free the individual from external restraint is also to
liberate society by giving it greater plasticity and permitting it to
assume new forms which are obviously better adapted to the happiness
and prosperity of the race.<a name="FNanchor_1345" id="FNanchor_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> Kropotkin in his delightful book
<i>Mutual Aid</i> gives numerous examples of this spontaneous social
instinct. He shows how it assumes different forms in the economic,
scientific, educational, sporting, hygienic, and charitable associations
of modern Europe; in the municipalities and corporations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
the Middle Ages; and how even among animals this same instinct,
which forms the real basis of all human societies, has enabled them
to overcome the natural dangers that threaten their existence.</p>

<p>Anarchist society must not be conceived as a <i>bellum omnium
contra omnes</i>, but as a federation of free associations which everyone
would be at liberty to enter and to leave just as he liked. This
society, Kropotkin tells us, would be composed of a multitude of
associations bound together for all purposes that demand united
action. A federation of producers would have control of agricultural
and industrial, and even of intellectual and artistic, production; an
association of consumers would see to questions of housing, lighting,
health, food, and sanitation. In some cases the federation of producers
would join hands with the consumers’ league. Still wider
groups would embrace a whole country, or possibly several countries,
and would include people employed in the same kind of work,
whether industrial, intellectual, or artistic, for none of these pursuits
would be confined to some one territory. Mutual understanding
would result in combined efforts, and complete liberty would give
plenty of scope for invention and new methods of organisation.
Individual initiative would be encouraged; every tendency to
uniformity and centralisation would be effectively checked.<a name="FNanchor_1346" id="FNanchor_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a></p>

<p>In such a society as this complete concord between the general
and the individual interests, hitherto so vainly sought after by the
<i>bourgeoisie</i>, would be realised once for all in the absolute freedom
now the possession of both the individual and the group, and
in the total disappearance of all traces of antagonism between
possessors and non-possessing, between governors and governed.
Again we note a revival of the belief in the spontaneous harmony of
interests which was so prominent a feature of eighteenth-century
philosophy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1347" id="FNanchor_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a></p>

<p>Such an attractive picture of society was bound to invite criticism.
The anarchists foresaw this, and have tried to meet most of the
arguments.</p>

<p>In the first place, would such extravagant freedom not beget
abuse, unjustifiable repudiation of contracts, crimes and misdemeanours?
Would it not give rise to chronic instability? and would
the conscientious never find themselves the victims of the fickle and
the fraudulent?</p>

<p>The anarchists agree that there may be a few pranks played, or,
as Grave euphemistically calls them, “certain acts apparently
altogether devoid of logic.”<a name="FNanchor_1348" id="FNanchor_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> But can we not reckon upon criticism
and disapproval checking such anti-social instincts? Public opinion,
if it were once freed from the warping influence of present-day
institutions, would possess far greater coercive force.<a name="FNanchor_1349" id="FNanchor_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> Our present
system of building prisons, “those criminal universities,” as
Kropotkin calls them, will never check these anti-social instincts.
“Liberty is still the best remedy for the temporary excesses of
liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_1350" id="FNanchor_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a> Moreover, such a system would enjoy a superior sanction
in the possible refusal of other people to work with those who could
not keep their word.<a name="FNanchor_1351" id="FNanchor_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> “You are a man and you have a right to
live. But as you wish to live under special conditions and leave the
ranks, it is more than probable that you will suffer for it in your daily
relations with other citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_1352" id="FNanchor_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a></p>

<p>But there is still a more serious objection. Were there no compulsion,
would anyone be found willing to work? The host of
idlers is at the present time vast, and without the sting of necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
it would become still greater. Kropotkin remarks that “it is
only about the sugar plantations of the West Indies and the
sugar refineries of Europe that robbery, laziness, and very often
drunkenness become quite usual with the bees.”<a name="FNanchor_1353" id="FNanchor_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> Is it not possible
that men are just imitating the bee?</p>

<p>The anarchists point out that many a so-called idler to-day is
simply a madcap who will soon discover his true vocation in the free
society of the future, and will thus be gradually transformed into
a useful member of society.<a name="FNanchor_1354" id="FNanchor_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> Moreover, does not the fact that so
many people shun work altogether prove that the present method
of organising society must be at once cruel and repugnant? The
certainty of being confined in an unhealthy workshop for ten or
twelve hours every day, with mind and body “to some unmeaning
task-work given,” in return for a wage that is seldom sufficient to
keep a family in decent comfort, is hardly a prospect that is likely
to attract the worker. One of the principal aims of the anarchist
<i>régime</i>—and in this respect it resembles the Phalanstère of Fourier—will
be to make labour both attractive and productive.<a name="FNanchor_1355" id="FNanchor_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> Science
will render the factory healthy well lighted and thoroughly ventilated.
Machinery will even come to the rescue of the housewife and
will relieve her of many a disagreeable task. Inventors, who are
generally ignorant of the unpleasant nature of many of these tasks,
have been inclined to ignore them altogether. “If a Huxley spent
only five hours in the sewers of London, rest assured that he would
have found the means of making them as sanitary as his physiological
laboratory.”<a name="FNanchor_1356" id="FNanchor_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> Finally, and most important of all, the
working day could then be reduced to a matter of four or five
hours, for there would no longer be any idlers, and the systematic
application of science would increase production tenfold.</p>

<p>The wonderful expansion of production under the influence of
applied science is a favourite theme of the anarchists. Kropotkin
has treated us to some delightful illustrations of this in his <i>Conquest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
of Bread</i>. He begins by pointing out the wonders already accomplished
by market gardeners living in the neighbourhood of Paris.
One of these, employing only three men working twelve to fifteen
hours a day, was able, thanks to intensive cultivation, to raise 110
tons of vegetables on one acre of ground. Taking this as his basis,
he calculates that the 3,600,000 inhabitants in the departments of the
Seine and the Seine-et-Oise could produce all the corn, milk, vegetables,
and fruit which they could possibly need in the year with fifty-eight
half-days labour per man. By parity of reasoning he arrives at the
conclusion that twenty-eight to thirty-six days’ work per annum
would secure for each family a healthy, comfortable home such as is
occupied by English working men at the present time. The same
thing applies to clothing. American factories produce on an average
forty yards of cotton in ten hours. “Admitting that a family needs
two hundred yards a year at most, this would be equivalent to fifty
hours’ labour, or ten half-days of five hours each,<a name="FNanchor_1357" id="FNanchor_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> and that all
adults save women bind themselves to work five hours a day
from the age of twenty or twenty-two to forty-five or fifty.…
Such a society could in return guarantee well-being to all its
members.”<a name="FNanchor_1358" id="FNanchor_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> Élisée Reclus shares these hopes. It seems to him
that “in the great human family hunger is simply the result of a
collective crime, and it becomes an absurdity when we remember
that the products are more than double enough for all the needs of
consumers.”<a name="FNanchor_1359" id="FNanchor_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a></p>

<p>Amid such superabundant wealth, in a world thus transformed
into a land of milk and honey, distribution would not be a very
difficult problem. Nothing really could be easier. “No stint or
limit to what the community possesses in abundance, but equal
sharing and dividing of those commodities which are scarce or apt
to run short.”<a name="FNanchor_1360" id="FNanchor_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a> Such was to be the guiding principle. In practice
the women and children, the aged and the infirm, were to come first
and the robust men last, for such even is the etiquette of the soup
kitchen, which has become a feature of some recent strikes. As to the
laws of value which are supposed to determine the present distribution
of wealth, and which the economists fondly believe to be necessary and
immutable, the anarchists regard them as being no concern of theirs.
The futility of such doctrines is a source of some amusement to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1361" id="FNanchor_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a></p>

<h4 id="heading84">IV: REVOLUTION</h4>

<p>But how is the beautiful dream to be realised? The way thither,
from the miserable wilderness wherein we now dwell to the Promised
Land of which they have given us a glimpse, lies through Revolution—so
the anarchist tells us.</p>

<p>A theory of revolution forms a necessary part of the anarchist
doctrine. In the mind of the public it is too often thought to be
the only message which the anarchists have to give. We must content
ourselves with a very brief reference to it, for the non-economic ideas
of anarchism have already detained us sufficiently long.</p>

<p>Proudhon is soon out of the running. We have already had
occasion to refer to his disapproval of violence and revolution. It
seemed to him that the anarchic ideal was for ever impossible apart
from a change of heart and a reawakening of conscience. But his
successors were somewhat less patient. To their minds revolution
seemed an unavoidable necessity from which escape was impossible.
Even if we could imagine all the privileged individuals of to-day
agreeing among themselves on the night of some fourth of August
to yield up every privilege which they possess and to enter the ranks
of the proletariat of their own free will, such a deed would hardly be
desirable. The people, says Reclus, with their usual generosity,
would simply let them do as they liked, but would say to their
former masters, “Keep your privileges.” “It is not because
justice should not be done, but things ought to find a natural
equilibrium. The oppressed should rise in their own strength, the
despoiled seize their own again, and the slaves regain their own
liberty. Such things can only really be attained as the result of a
bitter struggle.”<a name="FNanchor_1362" id="FNanchor_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a></p>

<p>It is not that Bakunin, Kropotkin, or their disciples revel in
bloodshed or welcome outbreaks of violence. Bloodshed, although
inevitably and inseparably connected with revolution, is none the
less regrettable, and should always be confined within the narrowest
limits. “Bloody revolutions are occasionally necessary because of
the crass stupidity of mankind; but they are always an evil, an
immense evil, and a great misfortune; not only because of their
victims, but also because of the pure and perfect character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
aims in view of which they are carried out.”<a name="FNanchor_1363" id="FNanchor_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> “The question,”
says Kropotkin,<a name="FNanchor_1364" id="FNanchor_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> “is not how to avoid revolutions, but how to secure
the best results by checking civil war as far as possible, by reducing
the number of victims, and by restraining the more dangerous
passions.” To do this we must rely upon people’s instincts, who,
far from being sanguinary, “are really too kind at heart not to be
very soon disgusted with cruelty.”<a name="FNanchor_1365" id="FNanchor_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> The attack must be directed
not against men but against their position, and the aim must be not
individuals but their status. Hence Bakunin lays great stress upon
setting fire to the national archives, and to papers of all kinds
relating to title in property, upon the immediate suppression of
all law courts and police, upon the disbanding of the army, and
the instant confiscation of all instruments of production—factories,
mines, etc. Kropotkin in the <i>Conquest of Bread</i> gives us a picture
of an insurgent commune laying hold of houses and occupying them,
seizing drapers’ establishments and taking whatever they need,
confiscating the land, cultivating it, and distributing its products.
If revolutionists only proceeded in this fashion, never respecting the
rights of property at all (which was the great mistake made by the
Commune in its dealing with the Bank of France during the rising
of 1871), the revolution would soon be over and society would
speedily reorganise itself on a new and indestructible basis and with
a minimum of bloodshed.</p>

<p>But the tone is not always equally pacific. Bakunin during at
least one period of his life preached a savage and merciless revolution
against privilege of every kind. At that time, indeed, he might
justly have passed as the inventor of the active propaganda which,
strenuously pursued for many years by a few exasperated fanatics,
had the effect of rousing public opinion everywhere against anarchism.
“We understand revolution,” someone has remarked, “in the sense
of an upheaval of what we call the worst passions, and we can
imagine its resulting in the destruction of what we to-day term
public order.” “Brigandage,” it is remarked elsewhere, “is an
honourable method of political propaganda in Russia, where the
brigand is a hero, a defender and saviour of the people.”<a name="FNanchor_1366" id="FNanchor_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
kind of proclamation entitled <i>The Principles of Revolution</i>, which,
as some writers point out, ought not to be attributed to Bakunin,
but which at any rate appears to give a fair representation of his
ideas at this period of his life, we meet with the following words:
“The present generation should blindly and indiscriminately destroy
all that at present exists, with this single thought in mind—to destroy
as much and as quickly as possible.”<a name="FNanchor_1367" id="FNanchor_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> The means advocated are
of a most varied description: “Poison, the dagger, and the sword
… revolution makes them all equally sacred. The whole field is
free for action.”<a name="FNanchor_1368" id="FNanchor_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> Bakunin had always shown a good deal of sympathy
for the <i>rôle</i> of the conspirator. In the <i>Statutes of the International
Brotherhood</i>, which prescribed the rules of conduct for a
kind of revolutionary association created by Bakunin in 1864, are
some passages advocating violence which are as bloodcurdling as
anything contained in Netchaieff’s famous <i>Revolutionary Catechism</i>.
It is difficult to find lines more full of violent revolutionary exasperation
than that passage of the <i>Statutes of the International Socialist
Alliance</i> which forms the real programme of the anarchists. Since
it also seems to us to give a fairly faithful expression of Bakunin’s
thoughts on the matter, it will afford a fitting close to our exposition.</p>

<p>“We want a universal revolution that will shake the social and
political, the economic and philosophical basis of society, so that of
the present order, which is founded upon property, exploitation,
dominion, and authority, and supported either by religion or
philosophy, by <i>bourgeois</i> economics or by revolutionary Jacobinism,
there may not be left, either in Europe or anywhere else, a single
stone standing. The workers’ prayer for peace we would answer
by demanding the freedom of all the oppressed and the death of
everyone who lords it over them, exploiters and guardians of every
kind. Every State and every Church would be destroyed, together
with all their various institutions, their religious, political, judicial,
and financial regulations; the police system, all university regulations,
all social and economic rules whatsoever, so that the millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
of poor human beings who are now being cheated and gagged,
tormented and exploited, delivered from the cruellest of official
directors and officious curates, from all collective and individual
tyranny, would for once be able to breathe freely.”<a name="FNanchor_1369" id="FNanchor_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a></p>

<p>A discussion of anarchist doctrine lies beyond our province.
Moreover, such sweeping generalisations disarm all criticism. Their
theories are too often the outbursts of passionate feeling and scarcely
need refuting. Let us, then, try to discover the kind of influence
they have had.</p>

<p>We are not going to speak of the criminal outrages which
unfortunately have resulted from their teaching. Untutored minds
already exasperated by want found themselves incapable of resisting
the temptations to violence in face of such doctrines. Such deeds,
or active propaganda as they call it, can have no manner of justification,
but find an explanation in the extreme fanaticism of the
authors. It is not very easy to attribute such violence to a social
doctrine which, according to the circumstances, may on the one
hand be considered as the philosophy of outrage and violence, and
on the other as an ideal expression of human fraternity and
individual progress.</p>

<p>The influence of which we would speak is the influence which
anarchy has had upon the working classes in general. Undoubtedly
it has led to a revival of individualism and has begotten a reaction
against the centralising socialism of Marx. Its success has been
especially great among the Latin nations and in Austria, where it
seemed for a time as if it would supplant socialism altogether. Very
marked progress has also been made in France, Italy, and Spain.
Is it because individuality is stronger in those countries than
elsewhere? We think not. The fact is that wherever liberty
has only recently been achieved, order and discipline, even
when freely accepted, seem little better than intolerable signs of
slavery.</p>

<p>An anarchist party came into being between 1880 and 1895. But
since 1895 it seems to have declined. This does not mean that the
influence of anarchism has been on the wane, but simply that it
has changed its character. In France especially many of the older
anarchists have joined the Trade Union movement, and have occasionally
managed to get the control of affairs into their own hands,
and under their influence the trade unions have tried to get rid of
the socialist yoke. The Confédération générale du Travail has for
its motto two words that are always coupled together in anarchist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
literature, namely, “Welfare and liberty.” It has also advocated
“direct action”—that is, action which is of a definitely revolutionary
character and in defiance of public order. Finally, it betrays the
same impatience with merely political action, and would have the
workers concentrate upon the economic struggle.</p>

<p>The prophets of revolutionary syndicalism deny any alliance
with anarchy. But, despite their protests, it would be a comparatively
easy matter to point to numerous analogies in the writings of
Bakunin and Kropotkin. Moreover, they admit that Proudhon, as
well as Marx, has contributed something to the syndicalist doctrine;
and we have already noted the intimate connection which exists
between Proudhon and the anarchists.</p>

<p>The first resemblance consists in their advocacy of violence as a
method of regenerating and purifying social life. “It is to violence,”
writes M. Sorel, “that socialism owes those great moral victories
that have brought salvation to the modern world.”<a name="FNanchor_1370" id="FNanchor_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> The anarchists
in a similar fashion liken revolution to the storm that clears the
threatening sky of summer, making the air once more pure and calm.
Kropotkin longs for a revolution because it would not merely
renew the economic order, but would also “stir up society both
morally and intellectually, shake it out of its lethargy, and revive
its morals. The vile and narrow passion of the moment would be
swept aside by the strong breath of a nobler passion, a greater
enthusiasm, and a more generous devotion.”<a name="FNanchor_1371" id="FNanchor_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a></p>

<p>In the second place, moral considerations, which find no place
in the social philosophy of Marx, are duly recognised by Sorel and
by the anarchist authors. Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Proudhon
especially demand a due respect for human worth as the condition
of every man’s liberty. They also proclaim the sovereignty of reason
as the only power that can make men really free. M. Sorel, after
showing how the new school may be easily distinguished from official
socialism by the greater stress which it lays upon the perfection of
morals, proceeds to add that on this point he is entirely at one with
the anarchists.<a name="FNanchor_1372" id="FNanchor_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a></p>

<p>Finally, their social and political ideals are the same. In both
cases the demand is for the abolition of personal property and the
extinction of the State. “The syndicalist hates the State just as
much as the anarchist. He sees in the State nothing but an unproductive
parasite borne upon the shoulder of the producer and living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
upon his substance.”<a name="FNanchor_1373" id="FNanchor_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> And Sorel regards socialism as a tool in the
hands of the workers which will some day enable them to get rid of
the State and abolish the rights of private property.<a name="FNanchor_1374" id="FNanchor_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> “Free
producers working in a factory where there will be no masters”<a name="FNanchor_1375" id="FNanchor_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a>—such
is the ideal of syndicalism, according to Sorel. There is also the
same hostility shown towards democracy as at present constituted
and its alliance with the State.</p>

<p>But despite many resemblances the two conceptions are really
quite distinct. The hope of anarchy is that spontaneous action and
universal liberty will somehow regenerate society. Syndicalism
builds its faith upon a particular institution, the trade union, which
it regards as the most effective instrument of class war. On this
basis there would be set up an ideal society of producers founded
upon labour, from which intellectualism would be banished. Anarchy,
on the other hand, contents itself with a vision of a kind of natural
society, which the syndicalist thinks both illusory and dangerous.</p>

<p>It has not been altogether useless, perhaps, to note the striking
analogy that exists between these two currents of thought which have
had such a profound influence upon the working-class movement
during the last fifteen years, and which have resulted in a remarkable
revival of individualism.</p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>Can a history of economic doctrines really be said to have a conclusion?</p>

<p>It is obviously impossible to regard the history of any science
as complete so long as that science itself is not definitely constituted.
This applies to all sciences alike, even to the more advanced—physics,
chemistry, and mathematics, for example, all of which
are continuously undergoing some modification, abandoning in the
course of their progress certain conceptions that were formerly
regarded as useful, but which now appear antiquated, and adopting
others which, if not entirely new, are at least more comprehensive
and more fruitful. And not only is this true of individual sciences,
but it is equally true of the very conception of science itself. Progress
in the sciences involves a modification of our ideas concerning
science. The savant, to-day as of yore, is engaged in the pursuit
of truth, but the conception of scientific truth at the beginning of
the twentieth century is not what it was at the beginning of the
nineteenth, and everything points to still further modifications of
that conception in the future. It is scarcely to be expected that
political economy, a young science hardly out of its swaddling-clothes,
will prove itself less mutable than the sciences already
mentioned. All that the historian is permitted to do is to point
to the distance already traversed, without pretending to be able
to guess the character of the road that still remains to be covered.
His object must be to appreciate the nature of the tasks that now
await the economist, and for this his study of the efforts put forth
in the past, to which the preceding chapters bear record, should
prove of some assistance.</p>

<p>A simple analogy will perhaps help us to gauge the kind of
impression left upon us by a study of a century and a half of economic
ideas. Imagine ourselves looking at a fan spread out in front of
us. At the handle the separate radii are so closely packed
together that they appear to form a single block. But as the eye
travels towards the circumference the branches gradually separate
from one another until they finally assume quite divergent positions.
But their separation is not complete, and the more they
are spread out the easier it is to detect the presence of the tissue
that forms a common bond between the various sections of the fan
and constitutes the basis of a new unity which is quite as powerful,
if not perhaps more so, than the unity which results from their
superposition at the base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span></p>

<p>So it was with the Physiocrats, and still more with Adam Smith,
whose theory of political economy was a doctrine of such beautiful
simplicity that the human mind could grasp it at a single glance.
But as time went on and the science progressed it was realised
that the unity which characterised it at first was more apparent
than real. The contradictory theories which Smith had seemed able
to reconcile gave rise to new currents of thought, which tended to
drift farther and farther apart as they assumed a greater degree
of independence. Conflicting theories of distribution and of value
began to take the field, and quarrels arose over the relative merits
of the abstract and the historical method, or the claims of society
and the rights of the individual. With a view to self-defence, each
of these schools took its own path, which it followed with varied
fortune, including not a few setbacks. Each of them also surrounded
itself with a network of observations and inductions, thus
bringing into the common fund a wealth of new truths and useful
conclusions. All this has resulted in the gradual formation, around
each great current of economic thought, of a thick enveloping layer
of great resistance and of increasing extent, which constitutes a kind
of common scientific matrix uniting them together, and underneath
which may still be detected the salient features of the great systems.
What strikes us now is not the multiplicity of branches which go
to make up the fan, but the presence of the common tissue in
which, especially towards the circumference, the different radii
seem to lose themselves and to disappear altogether. In other
words, the sum total of acquired truths is the only legacy left us
by the various systems of the past, and this is the only thing that
interests us to-day.</p>

<p>Hence one result of so much discussion and polemical warfare
has been the discovery of some common ground upon which all
economists, whatever their social and political aspirations, can
meet. This common ground is the domain of economic science—a
science that is concerned, not with the presentation of what ought
to be, but with the explanation and the thorough understanding
of what actually exists. The superiority of a theory is measured
solely by its explanatory power. It matters little whether its
author be Interventionist or Liberal, Protectionist or Free Trader,
Socialist or Individualist—everyone must necessarily bow before
an exact observation or a scientific explanation.</p>

<p>But while these divergent schools tend to be lost in the unity
of a more fully comprehended science, we see the emergence of
other divisions, less scientific perhaps, but much more fertile so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
far as the progress of the science itself is concerned. It seems as
if a new kind of fan arrangement were making its appearance underneath
the old.</p>

<p>This is obviously the case with regard to method, for example,
where the separation between pure and descriptive economics, or
between the theoretical systematisation and the mere observation
of concrete phenomena, is becoming very pronounced. Both kinds
of research are equally necessary, and demand different mental
qualities which are very seldom found combined in the same person.
Economic science, however, cannot afford to dispense either with
theory or observation. The desire to seize hold of the chain of
economic phenomena and to unravel its secret connections is as
strong as ever it was. On the other hand, in view of the transformation
and the daily modifications which industry everywhere
seems to be undergoing, it is useless to imagine that we can dispense
with the task of observing and describing these. The two methods
are developing and progressing together, and the violent quarrels
as to their respective merits appear to be definitely laid at rest.</p>

<p>Accordingly what we find is a segmentation of economic science
into a number of distinct sciences, each of which tends to become
more or less autonomous. Such separation does not necessarily
imply a conflict of opinion, but is simply the outcome of division
of labour. At the outset of its career the whole of political economy
was included within the compass of one or two volumes, and all
those facts and theories of which an economist was supposed to
have special knowledge were, according to Say and his disciples,
easily grouped under the three heads of Production, Consumption,
and Distribution. But since then the science has been broken
up into a number of distinct branches. The term “physics,”
which was formerly employed as a name for one of the exact
sciences, is just now little better than a collective name used to
designate a number of special sciences, such as electricity, optics,
etc., each of which might claim the lifelong devotion of the
student. Similarly “political economy” has just become a vague
but useful term to denote a number of studies which often differ
widely from one another. The theory of prices and the theory of
distribution have undergone such modifications as entitle them
to be regarded as separate studies. Social economics has carved
out a domain of its own and is now leading a separate existence,
the theory of population has assumed the dimensions of a special
science known as demography, and the theory of taxation is now
known as the science of finance. Statistics, occupying the borderland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
of these various sciences, has its own peculiar method of procedure.
Descriptions of the commercial and industrial mechanism
of banks and exchanges, the classification of the forms of industry
and the study of its transformations are related to political economy
much as zoology, descriptive botany, and morphology are related
to the science of natural history. And although a different name
must not always be taken as evidence of a different science, there
is little doubt about the existence of the separate sciences already
enumerated. The difficulty rather is to grasp the connection
between them and to realise the nature of that fundamental unity
which binds them all together.</p>

<p>But there still remains a wide region over the whole of which
divergences exist and conflicts continue, and where, moreover,
they will probably never cease. This is the realm of <i>social</i> and
<i>political</i> economics.</p>

<p>Despite the gradual rise of a consensus of scientific opinion among
economists, the divergences concerning the object that should be
pursued and the means employed to achieve that end are as pronounced
as ever. Each of the chief doctrines of which we have given
an exposition in the course of this work has its body of representatives.
Liberals, Communists, Interventionists, State and Christian
Socialists continue to preach their differing ideals and to advocate
different methods of procedure. On the question of the science
itself, however, they are all united. The arguments upon which
they base their contentions are largely borrowed from sources
other than scientific. Moral and religious beliefs, political or
social convictions, individual preference or sentiment, personal
experience or interest—these are among the considerations determining
the orientation of each. The earlier half of the nineteenth
century witnessed the science of political economy making common
cause with one particular doctrine, namely, Liberalism. The
alliance proved most unfortunate. The time when economic
doctrines were expected to lend support to some given policy is
for ever gone by. But the lesson has not been lost, and everybody
realises that nothing could be more dangerous for the development
of the science than to link its teaching to the tenets of some
particular school. At the same time the science might conceivably
furnish valuable information to the politician by enabling him to
foresee the results of such and such a measure; and it is to be hoped
that such predictions, all too uncertain as yet, may, accordingly,
become more precise in the future.</p>

<p>We cannot, then, suppose that the various currents of opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
to-day known as Liberalism, Socialism, Solidarism, Syndicalism,
and Anarchism are likely to disappear in the immediate future.
They may be given other names, perhaps, but they will always
continue to exist in some form or other, simply because they
correspond to some profound tendency in human nature or to
certain permanent collective interests which alternately sway mankind.</p>

<p>We cannot pretend to regret this. Uniformity of belief is an
illusory ideal, and from a purely practical point of view we should
be sorry to see the day when there will be no conflict of opinion
even about those causes or those methods which we hold most dear.</p>

<p>We may sum up our conclusions as follows: From a scientific
standpoint unity is likely to become more pronounced and collaboration
much more general than in the past, thanks to the adoption
of more scientific methods.</p>

<p>In the domain of practice the variety of economic ideals and
the conflict between them is likely to continue.</p>

<p>Such, it seems to us, will be the spectacle presented by the political
economy of the future.</p>

<p>Thus the impression obtained from a perusal of this history of
economic doctrines is, if not somewhat melancholy, at least sufficient
to justify a certain degree of humility. So many doctrines that we
thought definitely established have disappeared altogether, and so
many that we thought completely overthrown have been rehabilitated.
Those that die do not seem altogether dead, somehow, and
those that are revived are not quite the same.</p>

<p>What the science and its teachers need most of all is full and
complete liberty—liberty to follow whatever method suits them
best and to accept whatever theory attracts them most; liberty to
choose their own ideals and to formulate their own systems—for
systems and ideals, by bringing sentiment into play, may occasionally
prove very stimulating even to scientific research. Nothing could
be more harmful than the dogmatism which the science has only
recently escaped. In this matter, unfortunately, no school and no
country is entirely above criticism.</p>

<p>Sismondi used to complain that Liberalism, after it had achieved
its triumph, had attempted to convert political economy into a
system of orthodoxy. But Liberalism is not the only doctrine
against which a similar charge might be brought. It is only a
few years since Schmoller, the chief of the German Historical
school, in an address delivered as Rector of Berlin University,
declared that neither Marxians nor the disciples of Smith could in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
future be regarded as accredited teachers of the science. Does the
German Historical school really wish to revive that ostracism from
which it was itself one of the first to suffer? Neither can we, as
Frenchmen, pride ourselves upon having been less exclusive. The indifference
or even the actual hostility with which the Historical
school was for a long time treated does very little credit to us.
Moreover, that same intolerance of which “<i>bourgeois</i> economics”
was so justly accused, is it not to be met with in an equally extravagant
fashion in the socialism of to-day? The ultra-dogmatism
of the Liberal school can be easily paralleled from the history of
Marxism and the frantic efforts made by some socialists to prevent
other Marxians making a breach in the doctrine. If there is one
lesson more than another that emerges from a study of the
history of economic doctrines it is the necessity for a more critical
spirit and a more watchful attitude, always ready to test any new
truths that present themselves, to extend a hearty welcome to
every fresh observation or new experience, thus enabling the science
to enlarge its scope and gain a deeper significance without sacrificing
any of its essential tenets.</p>

the shorter becomes its history. Alembert truly remarks that the more light
we have on any subject the less need is there to occupy ourselves with the false

have a common master; a common doctrine in the <i>Philosophie rurale</i> and the
<i>Analyse économique</i>. Their classical literature is summed up in the generic
term Physiocracy. In the <i>Tableau économique</i> they possess a formula with
technical terms as precise as old Chinese characters.” This definition of the
Physiocrats, given by one of themselves, the Abbé Baudeau (<i>Éphémérides</i>, April
1776)—writing, we may be sure, in no malicious spirit—shows us that the school
possessed not a little of the dogmatism of the Chinee.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The first not only in chronological order but the chief recognised by all
was Dr. Quesnay (1694-1774), the physician of Louis XV and of Mme. de
Pompadour. He had already published numerous works on medicine, especially
the <i>Essai physique sur l’Économie animale</i> (1736) before turning his attention to
economic questions and more especially to problems of “rural economy.” His
first contributions, the essays on <i>Les Grains</i> and <i>Les Fermiers</i>, which appeared
in the <i>Grande Encyclopédie</i> in 1756 and 1757, were followed by his famous <i>Tableau
économique</i> in 1758, when he was sixty-four years of age, and in 1760 by his
<i>Maximes générales du Gouvernement économique d’un Royaume agricole</i>, which is
merely a development of the preceding work.</p>

<p>His writings were not numerous, but his influence, like that of Socrates,
disseminated as it was by his disciples, became very considerable.</p>

<p>The best edition of his works is that published by Professor Oncken of Berne,
<i>Œuvres économiques et philosophiques de F. Quesnay</i> (Paris and Frankfort, 1888).
Our quotations from the founders are taken from <i>Collections des Principaux
Économistes</i>, published by Daire.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Mirabeau, father of the great orator of the Revolution, a
man of a fiery temperament like his son, published at about the same date as the
production of the <i>Tableau</i> his <i>L’Ami des Hommes</i>. This book, which created a
great sensation, does not strictly belong to Physiocratic literature, for it ignores
the fundamental doctrine of the school. <i>La Théorie de l’Impôt</i> (1760) and <i>La
Philosophie rurale</i> (1763), on the other hand, owe their inspiration to Physiocracy.</p>

<p>Mercier de la Rivière, a parliamentary advocate, published <i>L’Ordre natural
et essentiel des Sociétés politiques</i> in 1767. Dupont de Nemours refers to this as
a “sublime work,” and though it does not, perhaps, deserve that epithet it
contains, nevertheless, the code of the Physiocratic doctrine.</p>

<p>Dupont de Nemours, as he is called after his native town published about
the same time, 1768, when he was only twenty-nine, a book entitled <i>Physiocratie,
ou Constitution essentielle du Gouvernement le plus avantageux au Genre humain</i>.
To him we owe the term from which the school took its name—Physiocracy,
which signifies “the rule of nature.” But the designation “Physiocrats” was
unfortunate and was almost immediately abandoned for “Économistes.”
Quesnay and his disciples were the first “Économistes.” It was only much
later, when the name “Economist” became generic and useless as a distinctive
mark for a special school, that writers made a practice of reverting to the
older term “Physiocrat.”</p>

<p>An enthusiastic disciple of Quesnay, Dupont’s <i>rôle</i> was chiefly that of a
propagandist of Physiocratic doctrines, and he made little original contribution
to the science. At an early date, moreover, the great political events in which
he took an active part proved a distraction. He survived all his colleagues,
and was the only one of them who lived long enough to witness the Revolution, in
which he played a prominent part. He successively became a deputy in the Tiers
État, a president of the Constituent Assembly, and later on, under the Directoire,
President du Conseil des Anciens. He even assisted in the restoration of the
Empire, and political economy was first honoured at the hands of the Institut
when he became a member of that body.</p>

<p>In 1777 Le Trosne, an advocate at the Court of Orleans, published a book
entitled <i>De l’Intérêt social, par rapport à la Valuer, à la Circulation, à l’Industrie
et au Commerce</i>, which is perhaps the best or at least the most strictly economic
of all. Mention must also be made of the Abbé Baudeau, who has no less than
eighty volumes to his credit, chiefly dealing with the corn trade, but whose
principal work is <i>L’Introduction à la Philosophie économique</i> (1771); and of the
Abbé Roubaud, afterwards Margrave of Baden, who had the advantage of
being not merely a writer but a prince, and who carried out some Physiocratic
experiments in some of the villages of his small principality.</p>

<p>We have not yet mentioned the most illustrious member of the school, both
in respect of his talent and his position, namely, Turgot (1727-81). His name is
generally coupled with that of the Physiocrats, and this classification is sufficiently
justified by the similarity of their ideas. Still, as we shall see, in many respects
he stands by himself, and bears a close resemblance to Adam Smith. Moreover,
he commenced writing before the Physiocrats. His essay on paper money dates
from 1748, when he was only twenty-one years of age, but his most important
work, <i>Réflexions sur la Formation et la Distribution des Richesses</i>, belongs to 1766.
As the Intendant of Limoges and again as a minister of Louis XVI he possessed
the necessary authority to enable him to realise his ideas of economic liberty,
which he did by his famous edicts abolishing taxes upon corn passing from one
province to another, and by the abolition of the rights of wardenship and privilege.</p>

<p>Unlike the other Physiocrats, who swore only by Dr. Quesnay, Turgot owed a
great deal to a prominent business man, Vincent de Gournay, who at a later
date became the Intendant of Commerce. Gournay died in 1759, at the early age
of forty-seven. Of Gournay we know next to nothing beyond what Turgot says
of him in his eulogy (See Schelle, <i>Vincent de Gournay</i>, 1897).</p>

<p><i>Bibliography.</i> Books dealing with the Physiocratic system, both in French
and other languages, are fairly numerous. A very detailed account of these
may be found in M. Weulersse’s work, <i>Le Mouvement physiocratique en France de
1756 à 1770</i>, published in 1910, which also contains a very complete exposition
of the Physiocratic doctrine. In English there is a succinct account of the system
in Higgs’ <i>Physiocrats</i> (1897).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> J. J. Rousseau, the author of the <i>Contrat Social</i> (1762), was a contemporary
of the Physiocrats, but he never became a member of the school.
Mirabeau’s attempt to win his allegiance proved a failure. The “natural
order” and the “social contract” seem incompatible, for the natural and spontaneous
can never be the subject of contract. One might even be tempted to think
that Rousseau’s celebrated theory was formulated in opposition to Physiocracy,
unless we remembered that the social contract theory is much older than
Rousseau’s work. Traces of the same idea may be found in many writings,
especially those inspired by Calvinism. To Rousseau the social question
seemed to be a kind of mathematical problem, and any proposed solution must
satisfy certain complicated conditions, which are formulated thus: “To find a
form of association which protects with the whole common force the person and
property of each associate, and in virtue of which everyone, while uniting himself
to all, obeys only himself and remains as free as before.” Nothing could well be
further from the Physiocratic view. Their belief was that there was nothing to
find and nothing to create. The “natural order” was self-evident.</p>

<p>It is true that Rousseau was an equally enthusiastic believer in a natural
order, in the voice of nature, and in the native kindness of mankind. “The
eternal laws of nature and order have a real existence. For the wise they serve
as positive laws, and they are engraved on the innermost tablets of the heart
by both conscience and reason.” (<i>Émile</i>, Book V.) The language is identical
with that of the Physiocrats. But there is this great difference. Rousseau
thought that the state of nature had been denaturalised by social and especially
by political institutions, including, of course, private property; and his chief
desire was to give back to the people the equivalent of what they had lost.
The “social contract” is just an attempt to secure this. The Physiocrats, on the
other hand, regarded the institution of private property as the perfect bloom of
the “natural order.” Its beauty has perhaps suffered at the hands of turbulent
Governments, but let Governments be removed and the “natural order” will at
once resume its usual course.</p>

<p>There is also this other prime difference. The Physiocrats regarded interest
and duty as one and the same thing, for by following his own interest the individual
is also furthering the good of everybody else. To Rousseau they seemed antagonistic:
the former must be overcome by the latter. “Personal interest is always
in inverse ratio to duty, and becomes greater the narrower the association, and
the less sacred.” (<i>Contrat Social</i>, ii, chap. 3.) In other words, family ties and
co-operative associations are stronger than patriotism.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> “There is a natural society whose existence is prior to every other human
association.… These self-evident principles, which might form the foundation
of a perfect constitution, are also self-revealing. They are evident not only to
the well-informed student, but also to the simple savage as he issues from the lap
of nature.” (Dupont, vol. i, p. 341.) Some Physiocrats even seem inclined to the
belief that this “natural order” has actually existed in the past and that men lost
it through their own remissness. Dupont de Nemours mournfully asks: “How
have the people fallen from that state of felicity in which they lived in those
far-off, happy days? How is it that they failed to appreciate the natural order?”
But even when interpreted in this fashion it had no resemblance to a savage
state. It must rather be identified with the Golden Age of the ancients or the
Eden of Holy Scripture. It is a lost Paradise which we must seek to regain.</p>

<p>The view is not peculiar to the Physiocrats, but it is interesting to note how
unfamiliar they were with the modern idea of evolutionary progress.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Pursuing this same idea, Dupont writes as follows: “It is thirteen years
since a man of exceptional genius, well versed in profound disquisition, and already
known for his success in an art where complete mastery only comes with careful
observation and complete submission to the laws of nature, predicted that natural
laws extended far beyond the bounds hitherto assigned to them. If nature
gives to the bee, the ant, or the beaver the power of submitting by common
consent and for their own interest to a good, stable, and equable form of government,
it can hardly refuse man the power of raising himself to the enjoyment of
the same advantages. Convinced of the importance of this view, and of the
important consequences that might follow from it, he applied his whole intellectual
strength to an investigation of the physical laws which govern society.”
Elsewhere he adds: “The natural order is merely the physical constitution which
God Himself has given the universe.” (Introduction to Quesnay’s works, p. 21.)</p>

<p>Hector Denis in his <i>Histoire des Doctrines</i> expresses the belief that the most
characteristic feature of the Physiocratic system is the emphasis laid upon a
naturalistic conception of society. He illustrates this by means of diagrams
showing the identity of the circulation of wealth and the circulation of the blood.</p>

especially Mirabeau and Mercier de la Rivière, assign it to Vincent
de Gournay, but Turgot, the friend and biographer of Vincent de Gournay,
attributes it, under a slightly different form, <i>laissez-nous faire</i>, to Le Gendre, a
merchant who was a contemporary of Colbert. Oncken thinks that the credit
must go to the Marquis d’Argenson, who employed the term in his <i>Mémoires</i> as
early as the year 1736. The formula itself is quite commonplace. It only became
important when it was adopted as the motto of a famous school of thinkers, so
that this kind of research has no great interest. For a discussion of this trivial
question, see the work of M. Schelle, <i>Vincent de Gournay</i> (1897), and especially

should supply the raw material and provide the necessary sustenance. When

trouble. The cultivators, on the other hand, produce their own raw material,
whether for use or for consumption, as well as everything that is consumed by
others. This is just where the difference between a productive and a sterile
class comes in.” (Baudeau, <i>Correspondance avec M. Graslin</i>.)</p>

they say that “the merchant who sells goods may occasionally prove as useful as
the philanthropist who gives them, because want puts a price upon the service of
the one just as it does upon the charity of the other.” (<i>Du Marchand de Grains</i>,
in the <i>Journal de l’Agriculture, du Commerce, et des Finances</i>, December 1773,
quoted in a thesis on the corn trade by M. Curmond, 1900.) We must insist upon
the fact that “unproductive” or “sterile” did not by any means signify “useless.”
They saw clearly enough that the labour of the weaver who makes linen
out of flax or cloth out of wool is at any rate as useful as that of the cultivator who
produced the wool and the flax, or rather that the latter’s toil would be perfectly
useless without the industry of the former. They also realised that although we
may say that agricultural labour is more useful than that of the weaver or the
mason, especially when the land is used for raising corn, one cannot say as
much when that same land is employed in producing roses, or mulberry trees
for rearing silkworms.</p>

scientific spirit, for even from their own point of view the question was one of
prime importance. No commodity could be produced without raw material, and
wealth is simply a collection of commodities. Raw material is furnished by
the mine as well as by the soil. In the history of mankind iron has played as important
a part as corn. Agriculture itself is an extractive industry, where the
miner—the agriculturist—uses plants instead of drills, and in both cases the
product is exhaustible.</p>

which have enriched and advanced them. The first is the invention
of writing, which alone gives human nature the power of transmitting without

the invention of money, which binds together all the relations between civilised
societies. The third is the Economical Table, the result of the other two, which
completes them both by perfecting their object; the great discovery of our age,
but of which our posterity will reap the benefit.” (Mirabeau, quoted in <i>Wealth

with a number of zigzag lines which cross from one column to another. If he had
been living now he would almost certainly have used the graphic method, which
would have simplified matters very considerably, and it is somewhat strange
that no one has attempted this with his <i>Tableau</i>. Hector Denis has compared his
tables with those of the anatomist and traced a parallel between the links of the
economical world and the plexus of veins and arteries in the human body.</p>

<p>His explanation of the <i>Tableau</i> by means of mathematical tables gives him
a claim to be considered a pioneer of the Mathematical school. Full justice
has been done to him in this respect. An article by Bauer in the <i>Quarterly
Journal of Economics</i>, 1890, recognises his claim, and there is another by Oncken
in the <i>Economic Journal</i> for June 1896, entitled <i>The Physiocrats as Founders
of the Mathematical School</i>. His contemporary Le Trosne is even more emphatic
on the point: “Economic science, being a study of measurable objects, is an
exact science, and its conclusions may be mathematically tested. What the
science lacked was a convenient formula which might be applied to test its
general conclusions. Such a formula we now have in the <i>Tableau économique</i>.”

it up admirably in the following: “What the labourers get from the land in
addition to what is sufficient to supply their own needs constitutes the only
wages fund [note the phrase], which all the other members of society can draw
upon in return for their labour. The other members of society, when they
buy the commodities which the labourer has produced, simply give him the bare
equivalent of what it has cost the labourer to produce them.” (Turgot, vol. i, p. 10.)

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> “In the third line—they generally occupy the first rank—we have the
landed proprietors who prepare the soil, build houses, make plantations and
enclosures at their own expense or who pay for those outlays by buying property
already developed. This revenue, they might argue, belongs to us because of
the wisdom and forethought we have exercised in preparing the land, in undertaking
to keep it in repair, and to improve it still further.” (Baudeau, <i>Philosophie
économique</i>, p. 757.) “The foremost and most essential agent of production
must be that man who makes it possible. But who is this agent but the landed
proprietor, whose claims to his prerogatives are based upon the need for his
productive services?” (Mercier de la Rivière, pp. 466-467.)</p>

<p>“It is this expenditure that makes the claim of proprietors real and their
existence just and necessary. Until such expenditure is incurred the right
of property is merely an exclusive right to make the soil capable of bearing
fruit.” (Baudeau, p. 851.) In other words, so long as the proprietor has not
incurred some expenditure the right of property is simply reduced to occupation.</p>

<p>The Physiocrats distinguished three kinds of <i>avances</i>:</p>

<p>1. The annual expenditure (<i>avances annuelles</i>) incurred in connection with
the actual work of cultivation, which recurs every year, such as the cost of seed
and manure, cost of maintaining labourers, etc. The annual harvest ought to
repay all this, which to-day would be called circulating capital.</p>

<p>2. The “original” outlay (<i>avances primitives</i>) involved in buying cattle and
implements which render service for a number of years, and for which the proprietor
does not expect to be recompensed in a single year. The return is spread
out over a number of years. Here we have the distinction between fixed and
circulating capital, and the idea of the gradual redemption of the former as against
the total repayment of the latter at one single use. It did not escape the Physiocrats’
notice that an intelligent increase of the fixed might gradually reduce the
annual expenditure. Such ideas were quite novel. But they immediately took
their place as definite contributions to the science. They are no longer confined
to agriculture, however, but apply equally to all branches of production.</p>

<p>3. The <i>avances foncières</i> are the expenses which are undertaken with a view to
preparing the land for cultivation. (The adjective “primitive” would have been
better applied here.)</p>

<p>The first two kinds of expenditure are incumbent upon the agriculturist and
entitle him to a remuneration sufficient to cover his expenses.</p>

<p>The third is incumbent upon the proprietor and constitutes his claim to a
share of the funds. “Before you can set up a farm where agriculture may be
steadily practised year in and year out what must be done? A block of buildings
and a farmhouse must be built, roads made and plantations set, the soil must
be prepared, the stones cleared, trees cut down and roots removed; drains must
also be cut and shelters prepared. These are the <i>avances foncières</i>, the work
that is incumbent upon proprietors, and the true basis of their claim to the
privileges of proprietorship.” (Baudeau, <i>Éphémérides</i>, May 1776. A reply to
Condillac.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> It is necessary to make a note here of one of the many differences between
Turgot and the Physiocrats. Turgot seems much less firmly convinced of the
social utility of landed property and of the legitimacy of the right of property.
He thinks that its origin is simply due to occupation. This weakens the
Physiocratic case very considerably. “The earth is peopled and cultivation
extends. The best lands will in time all be occupied. For the last comers
there will only be the unfertile lands rejected by the first. In the end every
piece of land will have its owner, and those who possess none will have no other
resource than to exchange the labour of their arm for the superfluous corn of the
proprietor.” (Vol. i, p. 12.) We are here not very far from the Ricardian theory.</p>

“He is responsible under pain of annihilation for the products of society, and
no part of the produce which goes to support the cultivator should wittingly
be employed otherwise.” The history of Ireland is an interesting commentary
on these words.</p>

<p>But let us always remember that when the Physiocrats speak of the rights
of the cultivator they think only of the farmer and <i>métayer</i> and never of the
paid agriculturist. They are content to demand merely a decent existence for the
latter. Were they put too much at ease they would perhaps leave off working.
See Weulersse, vol. ii, p. 729. He seems a little unjust, and quotes some words of
Quesnay, who protests against the belief that “the poor must be kept poor if they
are not to become indolent.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60" id="Footnote_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> One is perhaps surprised to find that freedom of work—in other words, the
abolition of corporations—is not included in their list, especially since the credit
for the downfall of those institutions is usually given to the Physiocrats. Their
writings contain only very occasional reference to this topic, because industrial
labour is regarded as sterile, and reform touching its organisation concerned them
but little. They did, however, protest against the rule that confined the right to
engage in a trade to those who had received an express privilege from the Crown.
They considered that “to an honest soul this was the most odious maxim which
the spirit of domination and rapacity ever invented.” (Baudeau, in <i>Éphémérides</i>,
1768, vol. iv.) Turgot’s famous <i>Edict</i> of January 1776, abolishing the
rights of corporations and establishing liberty for all, is, with good reason, attributed
to Physiocratic influence.</p>

stimulates production, and Boisguillebert, in an equal paradox, remarks that
“Low price gives rise to want.” In the <i>Maximes</i>, p. 98, Quesnay contents
himself by saying that free trade in corn makes the price more equal. “It is
clear,” he adds, “that, leaving aside the question of foreign debt, equal prices
will increase the revenue yielded by the land, which will again result in extended
cultivation, which will provide a guarantee against those dearths that decimate
population.”</p>

<p>Mercier de la Rivière writes in a similar vein. “A good constant average
price ensures abundance, but without freedom we have neither a good price nor
plenty.” (P. 570.)</p>

<p>Turgot in his <i>Lettres sur le Commerce des Grains</i> develops the argument at great
length and tries to give a mathematical demonstration of it. There was no need for
this. It is a commonplace of psychology that a steady price of 20 is preferable

foreseen by Quesnay—one of the most remarkable instances of scientific prevision
on record. In his article on corn in the <i>Encyclopédie</i> he says that he views
the fertility of the American colonies with apprehension and dreads the growth
of agriculture in the New World, but the fear is provisionally dismissed because
the corn is inferior in quality to that of France and is damaged in transit. (See our
remarks concerning the Physiocratic connection with modern Protectionist
theories.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> It must not be forgotten that the Protectionist system aided the development
of industry and retarded that of agriculture by its policy of encouraging
the exportation of manufactured products and its restrictions on the exportation
of agricultural products and raw materials with a view to securing cheap labour
and a plentiful supply of raw materials for the manufacturing industries. The
Protectionists were not concerned to prevent the exportation of corn. Both
Colbertism and Mercantilism sacrificed the cultivator by preventing the exportation
of corn and by allowing of its importation, while doing the exact
opposite for manufactured products.</p>

<p>“It is evident that a democratic sovereign—<i>i.e.</i> the whole people—cannot itself
exercise its authority, and must be content to name representatives. These
representatives are merely agents, whose functions are naturally transitory, and
such temporary agents cannot always be in complete harmony with every interest
within the nation. This is not the kind of administration contemplated by
the Physiocrats. The sovereignty of the natural order is neither elective
nor aristocratic. Only in the case of hereditary monarchy can all interests,
both personal and individual, present and future, be clearly linked with those of
the nation, by their co-partnership in all the net products of the territory submitted
to their care.” (Dupont, vol. i, pp. 359-360.)</p>

his letter to J. B. Say (p. 414) he notes “its tendency to corruption and canker,”

Labriola’s book, <i>Le Dottrine economiche di Quesnay</i>—seem to think that the Physiocratic
criticism proved fatal to feudal society, just as the socialistic criticism of
the present time is undermining the <i>bourgeois</i> society. Politically this is true
enough, for the Physiocrats advocated the establishment of a single supreme
monarch with undivided authority. Economically it is incorrect, for their
conception even of sovereignty and taxation is impregnated with feudal ideas.</p>

fellow proprietors a burden upon one’s property. And so the public revenue
is not burdensome to anyone, costs nothing, and is paid by no one. Hence, it
in no way curtails the amount of property which a person has.” (Dupont,

“in order that the sovereign power should always share in both the profits
and the losses of the producer.” And he addresses this important caution to
the proprietors: “Take no credit to yourselves for the increase in the revenue
of land. The thanks are really due to the growing efficiency of the sovereign
authority.” (P. 708.)</p>

that we need not be much concerned about helping them. All our interests
and wills will be linked to the interest and will of the sovereign, forming for our
common good a harmony which can only be regarded as the work of a kind
Providence that wills that the land shall be full of happy men.” This enchanting
picture only applies to future society, when the “natural order” will be established.

inspired by Cantillon. No discussion of his work is included in the text
because it was felt that it might interfere with the plan of the work as already
mapped out. There are several articles in various reviews which deal with
Cantillon’s work, the earliest being that contributed by Stanley Jevons to the

<p><a name="Footnote_126" id="Footnote_126"></a><a href="#FNanchor_126"><span class="label">[126]</span></a> The life of Adam Smith presents nothing remarkable. It is easily summed
up in the story of his travels, his professional activities, and the records of his
friendships, and among these his intimacy with Hume the philosopher has
become classical. He was born at Kirkcaldy, in Scotland, on June 5, 1723.
From 1737 to 1740 he studied at the University of Glasgow under Francis
Hutcheson, the philosopher, to whom he became much attached. From 1740 to
1746 he continued his studies at Oxford, where he seems to have worked steadily,
chiefly by himself. The intellectual state of the university was at that time
extremely low, and a number of the professors never delivered any lectures
at all. Returning to Scotland, he gave two free courses of lectures at Edinburgh,
one on English literature and the other on political economy, in the course
of which he defended the principles of commercial liberty. In 1751 he became
Professor of Logic at Glasgow, at that time one of the best universities in Europe.
Towards the end of the year he was appointed to the chair of Moral Philosophy,
which included the four divisions of Natural Theology, Ethics, Jurisprudence,
and Politics within its curriculum. In 1759 he published his <i>Theory of Moral
Sentiments</i>, which speedily brought him a great reputation. In 1764, when
forty years of age, he quitted the professorial chair at Glasgow University
and accompanied the young Duke of Buccleuch, son-in-law of Charles Townshend,
the celebrated statesman, on his travels abroad. With the young nobility of
this period foreign travel frequently took the place of a university training,
on account of the disrepute into which the latter had fallen. Smith was given a
pension of £300 a year for the rest of his life, so that the mere material advantage
was considerably in excess of his earnings as a professor. The years 1764-66
were spent in this way. A year and a half was passed at Toulouse, two months
at Geneva, where he met Voltaire, and another ten months at Paris. While
in Paris he became acquainted with the Physiocrats, particularly with Turgot and
the Encyclopædists. It was at Toulouse that he began his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>.
Returning to Scotland in 1767, he went to live with his mother, with the sole
object of devoting himself to this work. By 1773 the book was nearly complete.
But Smith moved to London, and the work did not appear till 1776. By this
achievement Smith crowned the great celebrity which he already enjoyed. In
January 1778 Smith was appointed Commissioner of Customs at Edinburgh, a
distinguished position which he held until his death in 1790.</p>

<p>All that we know of Smith’s character shows him to have been a man of
tender feelings and of great refinement of character. His absent-mindedness
has become proverbial. In politics his sympathies were with the Whigs. In
religion he associated himself with the deists, a school that was greatly in vogue
towards the end of the eighteenth century, and of which Voltaire, who was much
admired by Smith, was the most celebrated representative.</p>

<p>For a long time the only life of Smith which we possessed was the memoir
written by Dugald Stewart, <i>Account of the Life and Writings of Adam Smith</i>,
and read by him in 1793 before the Royal Society of Edinburgh. It appeared
in the <i>Transactions</i> of the society for 1794, and was published in volume form in
1811 along with other biographies, under the title of <i>Biographical Memoirs of
Adam Smith, Robertson, etc.</i>, by Dugald Stewart. To-day we are more fortunate.
John Rae in his charming <i>Life of Adam Smith</i> (London, 1895) has succeeded
in bringing to light all that we can know of Smith and his circle. To him
we are indebted for most of the details we have given. In 1894 James Bonar
published a catalogue of Smith’s library, containing about 2300 volumes, and
comprising about two-thirds of his whole library. A still more important contribution
to the study of Smith’s ideas has been made by Dr. Edwin Cannan,
who in 1896 published <i>Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms, delivered
in Glasgow by Adam Smith, from Notes taken by a Student in 1763</i> (Oxford).
This represents the course of lectures on political economy delivered by Smith
while professor at Glasgow. A manuscript copy of the notes taken in this
course by a student, probably in 1763, was accidentally discovered by a
London solicitor in 1876. These notes were in 1895 forwarded to Dr. Cannan
for publication. They are especially precious in helping us to understand Smith’s
ideas before his stay in France and his meeting with the Physiocrats. Of the
numerous editions of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> which have hitherto been published,
the more important are those of Buchanan, McCulloch, Thorold Rogers, and
Nicholson. The latest critical edition is that of Dr. Cannan, published in 1904 by
Methuen, containing very valuable notes. This is the edition we have used.</p>

theory of taxation. Here are the other three: “(ii) The tax which each individual
is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment,
the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain
to the contributor, and to every other person. (iii) Every tax ought to be levied
at the time, or in the manner, in which it is most likely to be convenient for the
contributor to pay it. (iv) Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take
out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible, over and
above what it brings into the public treasury of the State.” (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
Book V, chap. 2, part ii; Cannan, vol. ii, pp. 310-311.)</p>

in another paragraph in favour of progressive taxation. This is an instance of
a want of logic frequently evidenced in his writings. Speaking of taxes upon
rent, he remarks that they weigh more heavily upon rich than upon poor, because
the former in proportion to their income spend more upon house rent than the
latter. But “it is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to
the public expence, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something
more than in that proportion.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, Book V, chap. 2, part ii, art. 1; vol. ii,

country labourers is certainly more productive than that of merchants, artificers,
and manufacturers. The superior produce of the one class, however, does not
render the other barren or unproductive.” (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book IV, chap. 9;

here as elsewhere Smith entertains more than one opinion. In other passages
in the book he regards rent as a monopoly price “that enters into the composition
of the price of commodities in a different way from wages and profit. High or
low wages and profit, are the causes of high or low price; high or low rent is
the effect of it. It is because high or low wages and profit must be paid, in
order to bring a particular commodity to market, that its price is high or low.
But it is because its price is high or low; a great deal more, or very little more,
or no more, than what is sufficient to pay those wages and profit, that it affords
a high rent, or a low rent, or no rent at all.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, Book I, chap. 11; vol. i,
p. 147.)</p>

<p>It is impossible to reconcile these statements. In the one case rent is regarded
as a constituent element of price, in the other it is the effect of price.</p>

<p>In the first edition this contradiction was still more evident. In that edition
rent, along with profit and wages, was treated as a third determinant of value.
(See Cannan’s edition, vol. i, p. 51, note 7.) The paragraph was deleted from the
second edition, and rent was treated merely as a component part of the price.
This modification was perhaps the outcome of a letter written by Hume to Smith
on April 1, 1776, after he had read the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> for the first time. “I
cannot think,” says Hume, “that the rent of farms makes any part of the price
of the produce, but that the price is determined altogether by the quantity and
the demand.” (Quoted by Rae in his <i>Life of Adam Smith</i>, p. 286.) The celebrated
controversy as to whether rent enters into prices is not a thing of yesterday.
Its origin dates from the birth of political economy itself, and it will probably
only die with it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_147" id="Footnote_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> His error is partly due to the fact that he failed to distinguish between
the profits of the <i>entrepreneur</i> and the interest of the capitalist. Both with
Smith and with his successors the word “profit” signified a twofold revenue, and
this was perfectly correct so long as the <i>entrepreneur</i> was also a capitalist. The
word “interest” was reserved for the income of that person who lent capital but
who did not himself produce anything. The revenue “derived from stock,
by the person who manages or employs it, is called profit. That derived from it
by the person who does not employ it himself, but lends it to another, is called the
interest or the use of money.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, Book I, chap. 6; vol. i, p. 54.) J. B. Say
was the first to give us a definite idea of the <i>entrepreneur</i>. Had Smith realised
more clearly the functions of the <i>entrepreneur</i> he would probably have perceived:
(1) That the <i>entrepreneur</i>, in addition to paying interest on his capital, frequently
has to pay rent for the use of the soil; (2) that profit strictly so called includes
an element analogous to rent. According to Smith, profit was simply payment
for risks undergone or for work undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_163" id="Footnote_163"></a><a href="#FNanchor_163"><span class="label">[163]</span></a> For a long time economists were quite content with Smith’s theory of
capital. Like other portions of his work, it readily became classic, and subsequent
writers simply repeated it. To-day, however, this success hardly seems
to have been warranted. “It can scarcely be denied,” writes Cannan, “that
Smith left the whole subject of capital in the most unsatisfactory state.”
(<i>Theories of Production and Distribution</i>, p. 89.) If this remark needs any
justification we have it in the many discussions which have taken place on this
subject during the last fifty years, and which are not yet at an end. Some of
the most original works of recent years, Böhm-Bawerk’s <i>Positive Theory of
Capital</i>, for example, are entirely taken up with this topic. In England, America,
and Italy the best-known economists, Cannan, Fisher, and Pareto, have recently
revived the ancient notions, and the discussions which have followed are
sufficient evidence that Smith had by no means exhausted the subject. If
we carefully read Book II of the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, which is entirely
devoted to this topic, what do we find? We have a distinction drawn
between fixed and circulating capital borrowed from practical affairs, but
possessing no great scientific value; the very doubtful identification of
national capital with the sum of private capitals; a very unsatisfactory
attempt at differentiating between the notions of capital and revenue;
the affirmation that saving involves consumption, a paradox repeated <i>ad
nauseam</i> down to the days of Mill; the commonplace statement that capital
increases as saving grows; and, finally, the proposition that “capital limits
industry.”</p>

produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increased in its value by no
other means, but by increasing either the number of its productive labourers, or
the productive powers of those labourers who had before been employed. The
number of its productive labourers, it is evident, can never be much increased,
but in consequence of an increase of capital, or of the funds destined for maintaining
them. The productive powers of the same number of labourers cannot
be increased, but in consequence either of some addition and improvement to
those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labour; or of a more
proper division and distribution of employment. In either case an additional
capital is almost always required.”</p>

is by this time persuaded that, assuming the necessity for the co-operation of
capital, land, and labour in production, it is quite clear that the amount of produce
raised must depend upon the amount of each of these factors employed, and not
upon the amount of any one of them.</p>

<p>Smith had anticipated the arguments advanced by such socialists as
Rodbertus and Lassalle, who regard saving rather than labour as the source of
capital. “Parsimony, and not industry, is the immediate cause of the increase
of capital. Industry, indeed, provides the subject which parsimony accumulates.
But whatever industry might acquire, if parsimony did not save and store up,
the capital would never be the greater.” (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book II, chap. 3;

price of every particular commodity is regulated by the proportion between the
quantity which is actually brought to market, and the demand of those who are
willing to pay the natural price of the commodity, or the whole value of the rent,
labour, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither. Such people
may be called the effectual demanders, and their demand the effectual demand;
since it may be sufficient to effectuate the bringing of the commodity to market.
It is different from the absolute demand. A very poor man may be said in some
sense to have a demand for a coach and six; he might like to have it; but his
demand is not an effectual demand, as the commodity can never be brought
to market in order to satisfy it.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_170" id="Footnote_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_170"><span class="label">[170]</span></a> For Smith oppression meant the tyranny either of producers or consumers.
When profits are above the normal rate “it is a proof that something is either
bought cheaper or sold dearer than it ought to be, and that some particular
class of citizens is more or less oppressed either by paying more or by getting
less than what is suitable to that equality which ought to take place, and which
naturally does take place among all the different classes of them.” (<i>Ibid.</i>,
Book IV, chap. 7, part iii; vol. ii, p. 128.)</p>

<p>The correspondence between selling price and the cost of production seemed
to Smith to be of the very essence of justice. Complete correspondence would
realise the ideal of the just price.</p>

well known. “The word ‘value,’ it is to be observed, has two different meanings,
and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the
power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys.
The one may be called ‘value in use,’ the other ‘value in exchange.’ The things
which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange;
and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently
little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will
purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A
diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity
of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_172" id="Footnote_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_172"><span class="label">[172]</span></a> The statement has been qualified because in the passage referred to Smith
seems to define utility in the vulgar sense (<i>i.e.</i> utility as contrasted with mere
agreeableness). This want of exactness was corrected by Ricardo, and is the
subject of a searching criticism by Mill. The following passage from his <i>Lectures
on Justice</i> may serve to throw some light upon the definition: “There is no
demand for a thing of little use; it is not a rational object of desire.” Smith could
not conceive the possibility of a demand or even a desire for a commodity which
was useless from a rational point of view. But this is evidently a great mistake.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_173" id="Footnote_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> The radical separation of the two ideas was perhaps more a matter of
expression than of reasoning, for in his <i>Lectures on Justice</i>, p. 176, value in use,
coupled with the purchasing power possessed by those who desired the commodity,
was regarded as one of the elements which determined the demand for it and
fixed its market price. The whole discussion of the theory of value by Smith
is very unsatisfactory.</p>

(<i>Rivista di Scienza</i>, 1907, No. 2) expresses himself as follows: “Underneath
the actual prices quoted on the exchanges, prices varying according to the exigencies
of time and place and dependent upon an infinite number of circumstances,
is there nothing which has any constancy or is in any degree less variable?
This is the problem that political economy must solve.”</p>

Smith seems to imply that the value of an object is determined, not by the amount
of labour which it cost to produce it, but by the amount of labour which can be
bought in exchange for it. Fundamentally the two ideas are one, for objects of
equal value only can be exchanged, so that the amount of labour anyone can
buy with any given object is equal to the amount of labour which that object
cost to produce. “Goods,” says Smith, “contain the value of a certain quantity
of labour, which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the
value of an equal quantity.”</p>

at reconciliation: “In this state of things [where labour and capital have
already been appropriated] the whole produce of labour does not always belong
to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock
which employs him. Neither is the quantity of labour commonly employed
in acquiring or producing any commodity, the only circumstance which can
regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or
exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be due for the profits
of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished the materials of that
labour.” At the beginning of the passage the workman shared the produce
of his labour and profits constituted a deduction from the value created by labour
alone; at the end of the paragraph profits issue from a supplementary value which
is an addition to the value already given it by labour. Other passages where the
two conceptions come into contact are also cited by Böhm-Bawerk. Interest
and rent are also occasionally taken as evidence that the workman is being
exploited, and this entitles Smith to be regarded as the father of socialism. More
than one passage in his work seems to point to this conclusion. “In other
countries, rent and profit eat up wages, and the two superior orders of people
oppress the inferior one.” (Book IV, chap. 7, part ii; vol. ii, p. 67.) Concerning
property he writes: “Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the
security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the
poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.”
(Book V, chap. 1, part ii; vol. ii, p. 207.) And finally there is the famous passage
from the sixth chapter: “As soon as the land of any country has all become
private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never
sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.… He [the workman]
must then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord
a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what
comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent of land,
and in the price of the greater part of commodities makes a third component
part.” (Book I, chap. 6; vol. i, p. 51.) Dr. Cannan in his <i>History of the Theories
of Production and Distribution</i> goes the length of declaring that the theory of
spoliation is the only one in Smith’s work. It is to Smith that we owe that idea
so frequently expressed by socialists, namely, that the workman in modern society
never really obtains the produce of his toil.</p>

days of the New Testament would effect so many welcome changes when it
became thoroughly known (J. Rae, p. 360). By the beginning of the nineteenth
century its influence had become predominant. All the Prussian statesmen
who aided Stein in the preparation and execution of those important reforms
that gave birth to modern Prussia were thoroughly versed in Smith’s doctrines,
and the Prussian tariff of 1821 is the first European tariff in which they
are deliberately applied. (Cf. Roscher, <i>Geschichte der Nationalökonomik in

he entered the employment of an assurance company, and took part as a
volunteer in the campaign of 1792. From 1794 to 1800 he edited a review
entitled <i>Décade philosophique, littéraire et politique, par une Société de Républicains</i>.
He was nominated a member of the Tribunate in 1799. After the publication
of his <i>Traité</i>, the First Consul, having failed to obtain a promise that the financial
proposals outlined in the first edition would be eliminated in the second, dismissed
him from the Tribunate, offering him the post of director of the <i>Droits
réunis</i> as compensation. Say, who disapproved of the new <i>régime</i>, refused,
and set up a cotton factory at Auchy-les-Hesdins in the Pas-de-Calais. He
realised his capital in 1813, returned to Paris, and in 1814 published a second
edition of his treatise. In 1816 he delivered a course of lectures on political
economy at the Athénée, probably the first course given in France. These lectures
were published in 1817 in his <i>Catéchisme d’Économie politique</i>. In 1819
the Restoration Government appointed him to give a course on “Industrial
Economy” (the term “Political Economy” was too terrible). In 1831 he was
made Professor of Political Economy in the Collège de France. He died in 1832.
His <i>Cours complet d’Économie politique</i> was published, in six volumes, in 1828-29.</p>

goods would seldom be too many if everyone were given complete freedom.”
Too much stress has possibly been laid on the phrase “Certain products are
superabundant just because others are wanting,” and it has been taken as implying
that even partial over-production is an impossibility. A note inserted on
the next page helps to clear up the matter and to prevent misunderstanding.
“The argument of the chapter,” says he, “is not that partial over-production
is impossible, but merely that the production of one thing creates the demand
for another.” He certainly seems unfaithful to his own position in the letters
he wrote to Malthus, in which he tries to defend his own point of view
by saying that “production implies producing goods that are demanded,” and
that consequently if there is any excessive production it is not the fault of
production as such and cannot be regarded as <i>over-production</i>. In greater conformity
with his own views and much nearer the truth is his reply to an article
by Sismondi published in 1824 in the <i>Revue encyclopédique</i> under the title <i>Sur
la Balance des Consommations avec les Productions</i> (<i>Œuvres diverses</i>, p. 250). His
statements vary from one edition to another, and anything more unstable than
Say’s views on this question would be difficult to imagine. The formula “Products
exchange for products” is so general that it includes everything, but means
nothing at all; for what is money, after all, if it is not a product?</p>

in too absolute a fashion, perhaps, the superiority of the French economists
over Ricardo. “The true doctrine may be more or less clearly traced through
the writings of a succession of great French economists, from Condillac, Baudeau,
and Le Trosne, through J. B. Say, Destutt de Tracy, Storch, and others, down
to Bastiat and Courcelle-Seneuil. The conclusion to which I am ever more
clearly coming is that the only hope of attaining a true system of economics
is to fling aside, once and for ever, the mazy and preposterous assumptions of the
Ricardian School.” (Preface, p. xlix.)</p>

among others, in his book <i>Le Radicalisme philosophique</i>, remarks that Ricardo,
Malthus, and their disciples were regarded as the exponents of optimism and
quietism. But in what sense were they optimists? Of course they believed
that the existing economic order is the best possible, and that it would be impossible
to change it for a better. That may be. But we prefer to think of them as

<p><a name="Footnote_290" id="Footnote_290"></a><a href="#FNanchor_290"><span class="label">[290]</span></a> Thomas Robert Malthus was born in 1766. His father, a country gentleman,
was a man of learning and a friend of most of the philosophers of his time,
especially Hume, and, it also seems, J. J. Rousseau. He was the youngest
son of the family, and was intended for the Church and given an excellent
education. After leaving Cambridge he took a living in the country, but in
1807 was appointed professor at a college founded by the East India Company
at Haileybury, in Hertfordshire, where he remained until his death in
1834. He married when thirty-nine years of age, and had three sons and a
daughter.</p>

<p>Malthus was a young unmarried clergyman living in a small country parish
when, at the age of thirty-two, he in 1798 published anonymously his famous
<i>Essay on the Principle of Population as it affects the Future Improvement of Society</i>.
His critics were legion. In order to devote more study to the subject, he
took a three years’ tour (1799-1802) on the Continent—avoiding France, because
France at this period was anything but inviting to an Englishman. In 1803 he
published—under his own name this time—a second edition, much modified and
amplified, and with a slightly different title: <i>An Essay on the Principle of
Population, or a View of its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness</i>. Four
other editions were published during his lifetime.</p>

<p>We must not forget his other works, although they were all eclipsed by his
earliest effort. These were: The <i>Principles of Political Economy considered
with a View to their Practical Application</i> (1820); <i>A Series of Short Studies dealing
with the Corn Laws</i> (1814-15); <i>On Rent</i> (1815); <i>The Poor Law</i> (1817); and
finally his <i>Definitions in Political Economy</i> (1827).</p>

Population is Remote.” “There are few States in which there is not a constant
effort in the population to increase beyond the means of subsistence. This
constant effort as constantly tends to subject the lower classes of society to
distress, and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition.”
(P. 10.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_295" id="Footnote_295"></a><a href="#FNanchor_295"><span class="label">[295]</span></a> If two children were the normal issue of every marriage, population would
evidently diminish, for all the children will not reach the marriageable age. Of
those that do all will not become parents. Experience seems to show that with
a birth-rate of less than three per family population does not increase, or if
it does grow at all it is almost imperceptibly. This is the case in France, where
on an average there are 2·70 births to every marriage.</p>

<p>To justify multiplying by two, Malthus regards a family of six as being a normal
one. Of the six, two will die before attaining marriageable age, or will remain
celibates, so that we are left with four, who will in turn become parents, and so we
have the series 2, 4, etc.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_296" id="Footnote_296"></a><a href="#FNanchor_296"><span class="label">[296]</span></a> The statement that population doubles every twenty-five years might
appear to be confirmed by the growth of population in the United States. It
is curious to find that the population there during the nineteenth century
conforms exactly to Malthus’s formula. In 1800 it was 5 millions. Doubling
four times (4 periods of 25 years = 100) gives us a population of 80 millions,
which is actually the figure for 1905, five years after the end of the century.
But of course this is pure chance, the increase resulting from immigration rather
than a rising birth-rate.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_297" id="Footnote_297"></a><a href="#FNanchor_297"><span class="label">[297]</span></a> It was in this connection that Malthus penned those famous words which
have been so frequently brought up against him, although they were omitted
from a later edition. “A man who is born into a world already possessed, if
he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and
if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of <i>right</i> to the smallest portion
of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At Nature’s mighty feast
there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone.…” On the other
hand, let us remember his services in reorganising public assistance in England
in 1832.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_298" id="Footnote_298"></a><a href="#FNanchor_298"><span class="label">[298]</span></a> “The effect of anything like a promiscuous intercourse which prevents the
birth of children is evidently to weaken the best affections of the heart and in
a very marked manner to degrade the female character. And any other intercourse
would, without improper arts, bring as many children into the society as
marriage, with a much greater probability of their becoming a burden to it.”
(P. 450.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_299" id="Footnote_299"></a><a href="#FNanchor_299"><span class="label">[299]</span></a> “These considerations show that the nature of chastity is not, as some
have supposed, a forced produce of artificial society; but that it has the most
real and solid foundation in nature and reason; being apparently the only
virtuous means of avoiding the vice and misery which result so often from the
principle of population.” (P. 450.)</p>

<p>He also notes that this virtue has usually been especially commended to
women, but that “there is no reason for supposing that the violation of the laws
of chastity are not equally dishonourable for both sexes.” Malthus evidently
believed in one moral law for both sexes.</p>

<p>Consequently whenever the reverend gentleman is reproached with encouraging
blasphemy, a point upon which he is particularly sensitive—for example,
when it is pointed out that God’s injunction to man was to increase and multiply—he
has no difficulty in showing that if procreation is the will of Providence,

<p>“I have said what I conceive to be strictly true, that it is our duty to defer

much less both, of these duties to be completely fulfilled. In this and a number of
other cases, it may happen that the violation of one of two duties will enable a
man to perform the other with greater facility.… The moralist is still bound
to inculcate the practice of both duties, and each individual must be left to act as his

think that the vices which relate to the sex are the only vices which are to be
considered in a moral question.” (P. 462.) Malthus omits to mention the
particular vice which he has in mind. “I have not the slightest hesitation in
saying that the prudential check [note the word—no longer “moral restraint”]
to marriage is better than premature mortality.” (P. 560.) We are far removed
from the first edition, where there is no mention of a third alternative between
chastity and vice.</p>

<p>This is Manu’s law, which Malthus quotes in support of his contention. But
he failed to see that as soon as one begins to doubt Manu’s teaching the argument
is the other way. One of the reasons why sterility was considered a dishonour by
Jewish women was that each of them secretly hoped that she might become the
mother of the promised Messiah. But when the Jews ceased to hope for the
Deliverer that was to come, then the incentive to childbirth was gone.</p>

when the actual price of labour joined to what they might have saved in their

and five or six children without assistance.” (P. 536.) Marriage seems prohibited
to every worker whose wages are not enough to keep eight persons,

<p><a name="Footnote_310" id="Footnote_310"></a><a href="#FNanchor_310"><span class="label">[310]</span></a> His views concerning charity are exceedingly interesting, and are directly
connected with his theory of population. This was the practical question about
which he was most concerned, and his influence in this direction has been very
considerable. He showed himself an uncompromising opponent of the English
Poor Law as it then existed. Speaking of the famous 43rd of Elizabeth, he
declares that one of its clauses is “as arrogant and as absurd as if it had enacted
that two ears of wheat should in future grow where one only had grown before.
Canute, when he commanded the waves not to wet his princely foot, did not in
reality assume a greater power over the laws of nature.” Since public assistance
cannot create wealth, it cannot either keep alive a single pauper. “It may
at first appear strange, but I believe it is true, that I cannot by means of money
raise the condition of a poor man … without proportionally depressing others
in the same class.” But it may be pointed out that although charity cannot
beget wealth it does transfer a certain portion of wealth from the pockets of the
rich to fill the mouths of the hungry poor. The consumption of the one is
increased just as much as the other’s is decreased.</p>

<p>Not only does he condemn charity in the way of almsgiving, but also the
practice of giving work for charity’s sake. He admits an exception in the
case of education, of which everybody can partake without making anyone
else the poorer. Such arguments would seem to imply the prohibition of
all charity, whether public or private, and as a matter of fact he demands
the gradual abolition of the Poor Laws and of every kind of systematic
assistance which offers to the poor any kind of help upon which they can
always reckon. But he recognises the “good results of private charity, discriminately
and occasionally exercised.” Though he failed to remove the Poor
Laws, the effect of his teaching is clearly seen in the Poor Law Amendment Act
of 1834.</p>

<p>Malthus’s doctrine is just the reverse of the social teaching on the question in
France at the present time. There you have an attempt to substitute solidarity for
Christian charity. That means that the poor should be able to demand assistance,
not as a gift, but as a right, and that the place of individual or private charity
should be taken by a public institution with a view to giving effect to this. His
teaching concerning the preventive obstacle has been so thoroughly taken to
heart that there is not much fear of legal assistance resulting in a growth of
population.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_311" id="Footnote_311"></a><a href="#FNanchor_311"><span class="label">[311]</span></a> It is not proved, however, that such were Malthus’s views. Private property,
at least peasant proprietorship, acts as a stimulus to population. And it is very
curious to think that he should have taken his illustration from France, where
the multiplication of small farms is considered one of the causes of the falling
birth-rate. “At all times the number of small farmers and proprietors in France
was great, and though such a state of things is by no means favourable to the
clear surplus produce or disposable wealth of a nation, yet sometimes it is not
unfavourable to the absolute produce, and it has always a strong tendency to
encourage population.” And again: “Even in France, with all her advantages
of situation and climate, the tendency of population is so great and the want of
foresight among the lower classes so remarkable.…” Godwin and Young
express similar opinions. The latter is quoted by Malthus: “The predominant
evil of the kingdom is the having so great a population that she can neither
employ nor feed it.” (P. 509.)</p>

<p>Marriage, Malthus thought, had a restraining influence upon population. He
admits that the simplest and most natural obstacle is to oblige every father
to rear his own children. He also admits that the shame which the mother of
a bastard and her child have to endure is a matter of social necessity. He does
not approve of forcing the man who has betrayed a woman to marry, but he
declares that seduction ought to be seriously punished. This is the view
commonly adopted to-day, but it was very novel then.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_312" id="Footnote_312"></a><a href="#FNanchor_312"><span class="label">[312]</span></a> There are some sociologists who, like Malthus, would seek an explanation
both of depopulation and of over-population in biological causes. Fourier and
Doubleday, for example, are among the number. Doubleday, who wrote forty
years before Malthus, believed that fecundity varied inversely with subsistence,
and that this acted as a kind of natural check upon the growth of population.
There are others, again, who think that reproductive capacity varies inversely
with intellectual activity. Both explanations seem to suggest a kind of opposition
between the development of the individual and the progress of the race
which is very suggestive. But their views have not gained many adherents.
If they are ever proved, which is not very likely, the prospect is not an attractive
one. It would mean that those nations and classes who have risen to a position
of ease through their superior culture would disappear, while the poorer, uncultured
masses would continue to increase.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_313" id="Footnote_313"></a><a href="#FNanchor_313"><span class="label">[313]</span></a> David Ricardo was descended from a Jewish family originally domiciled in
Holland. He was born in 1772 in London, where his father had settled as a stockbroker.
He entered business at an early age, and soon became thoroughly conversant
with the intricacies of banking and exchange. On the occasion of his
marriage he changed his religion, and thus incurred the displeasure of his
family. Setting up as a broker on his own account, he was not long in amassing
a huge fortune, estimated at about £2,000,000—an enormous sum for those
days.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, his earliest interest in economics centred round banking
questions. The French wars had caused a depreciation in the value of the
bank-note, and this aroused the interest not only of the specialists, but also of
the public. His first essay, published in 1810, when he was thirty-eight years of
age, was entitled <i>The High Price of Bullion a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank-notes</i>.
It was soon followed by other studies dealing with banks and with the
credit system. But these short polemical efforts gave scarcely any indication
of the great attention which he was bestowing upon the principles of the science.
His interest was primarily personal, for it appears that he had no intention
of publishing anything on the subject. In 1817, however, the results were seen
in a volume entitled <i>The Principles of Political Economy</i>. Ricardo the business
man could hardly have guessed that it would shake the capitalistic edifice to
its very foundations.</p>

<p>In 1819 he was elected a member of the House of Commons, but he was as
indifferent a speaker as he was a writer. He was always listened to, however, with
the greatest respect. “I have twice attempted to speak,” he writes, “but I
proceeded in the most embarrassed manner: and I have no hope of conquering
the alarm with which I am assailed the moment I hear the sound of my own
voice.” In 1821 he founded the Political Economy Club, the earliest of those
numerous societies for the study of economic subjects which have since been
established in every country. In 1822 he published a work on <i>Protection to Agriculture</i>.
The following year he died, at the comparatively early age of fifty-one.</p>

<p>Since his death all his writings have been carefully collected, and his correspondence
with the chief economists of his day, with Malthus, McCulloch, and
Say, published. The correspondence is extremely important for an understanding
of his doctrines.</p>

appears here under the very name of Ricardo, for he was unsuccessful in freeing
himself altogether from its influence. He defines rent as “that portion of the
produce of the earth which is paid to the landlord for the use of the original and
indestructible powers of the soil.” He continually refers to these powers of the
soil, which are described as “natural,” “primitive,” “indestructible,” <i>i.e.</i> as
independent of all labour.</p>

possesses over every other source of useful produce on account of the surplus
which it yields in the form of rent. Yet when land is most abundant, when most
productive and most fertile, it yields no rent, and it is only when its powers
decay … that rent appears.” (<i>Principles</i>, ed. Gonner, p. 52.)</p>

<p>“The comparative scarcity of the most fertile lands is the cause of rent.”
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 395.)</p>

of public opinion, passed during the latter part of the eighteenth and the beginning

fewer than 3835 such Acts were passed, involving the enclosure of 7,622,664 acres,
most of it common land. Not until 1845 do we find a change either in the attitude

new lands or whether this high price is the cause of the cultivation of new lands.

might very well become No. 1, if, instead of being employed in the cultivation
of corn, an intelligent husbandman were to put it to viticulture or rose-growing.
But this is to beg the question. The law of rent implies products of the same
kind, for it is this identity of quality that enables them to be sold at the same
price. If bad corn-land could become good rose-growing ground, then of course it
would take its place among rose-growing areas, yielding rent as soon as less fertile
lands were employed for the same purpose.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_329" id="Footnote_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> Turgot, <i>Observations sur un Mémoire de M. de Saint-Péravy</i> (<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. i,
p. 420). “It can never be imagined that a doubling of expenditure would result
in doubling the product.… It is more than probable that by gradually increasing
the expenditure up to the point where nothing would be gained on the
return, such items would successively become less fruitful. The earth’s fertility
resembles a spring that is being pressed downwards by the addition of successive
weights. If the weight is small and the spring not very flexible, the first attempts
will leave no results. But when the weight is enough to overcome the first
resistance then it will give to the pressure. After yielding a certain amount it will
again begin to resist the extra force put upon it, and weights that formerly would
have caused a depression of an inch or more will now scarcely move it by a hair’s
breadth. And so the effect of additional weights will gradually diminish.</p>

<p>“The comparison is not very exact, but it is near enough to enable us to
understand that when the earth is producing nearly all it can, a great deal of
expense is necessary to obtain very little more produce.”</p>

<p>Turgot, with his usual perspicacity, has noted a fact which the Classical writers
generally failed to perceive, namely, that at the beginning of the process of
cultivation there may be a period when the return shows no signs of diminishing.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_330" id="Footnote_330"></a><a href="#FNanchor_330"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> We must note the fact that the law of diminishing returns was already
implied in the second of the famous progressions given by Malthus, for an arithmetical
progression that shows an increase of one every twenty-five years
implies an addition slower than the growth of the series itself, <i>i.e.</i> slower than
the movement of time. Let us take land that yields one; in twenty-five years it
will yield two, an increase of 100 per cent. But this is only the first step. At the
end of another twenty-five years it will yield three, the increase being always one.
But the increase from two to three means an increase of only 50 per cent., from
three to four of only 33 per cent., and so on to 25 per cent. and 20 per cent. When
the hundredth place has been reached, the increase will only be 1 per cent., and
it will continue to fall farther, only more slowly.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_331" id="Footnote_331"></a><a href="#FNanchor_331"><span class="label">[331]</span></a> Ricardo gives a slightly different explanation. “If with a capital of £1000
a tenant obtains 100 quarters of wheat from his land, and by the employment of
a second capital of £1000 he obtains a further return of eighty-five, his landlord
would have the power at the expiration of his lease of obliging him to pay fifteen
quarters, or an equivalent value for additional rent, for there cannot be two rates
of profit.” (<i>Principles</i>, ed. Gonner, p. 48.) He means to say that if profits fall
because new capital is less productive than old, rent must necessarily appear,
because by definition rent is what remains of the produce after deducting profits
and wages. This explanation closely resembles that one given by West in his
<i>Application of Capital to Land</i>, published in 1815, and Ricardo was not above
acknowledging his indebtedness to West.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_332" id="Footnote_332"></a><a href="#FNanchor_332"><span class="label">[332]</span></a> Shortly afterwards a German landowner published a book dealing with just
that side of the problem of rent which had been neglected by Ricardo, namely,
the influence of distance from a market upon cultivation and the price of products.
We are referring to Thünen, who in his book <i>Der Isolerte Staat</i> (vol. i,
1826) draws a picture of a town surrounded by a belt of land, and shows how
cultivation will be distributed in concentric zones around that centre, and how
the kind of cultivation adopted will be a function of the distance.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_333" id="Footnote_333"></a><a href="#FNanchor_333"><span class="label">[333]</span></a> But the honour of discovering this law, which is so important for an understanding
of exchange value, does not belong entirely to Ricardo. Forty years
before a humble Scotch farmer named Anderson had observed the phenomenon
and given a very satisfactory analysis of it in his book <i>Observations on the Means
of Exciting a Spirit of National Industry</i> (1777). “Now as the expense of cultivating
the least fertile soil is as great or greater than that of the most fertile field,
it necessarily follows that if an equal quantity of corn, the produce of each field,
can be sold at the same price, the profit on cultivating the most fertile soil must
be much greater than that of cultivating the other, and as this continues to
decrease as the sterility increases, it must at length happen that the expense of
cultivating some of the inferior soils will equal the values of the whole produce.”
(Quoted by Jevons, <i>Theory of Political Economy</i>, p. 229.) Anderson’s name was
forgotten until quite recently, when it attracted a certain amount of attention
among the pioneers of Ricardo. Ricardo himself does not seem to be aware of
his existence; at least he never quotes him. The only two writers mentioned
by Ricardo are Malthus and West.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_340" id="Footnote_340"></a><a href="#FNanchor_340"><span class="label">[340]</span></a> “The dealings between the landlord and the public are not like dealings in
trade, whereby both the seller and the buyer may equally be said to gain, but
the loss is wholly on one side and the gain wholly on the other.” (<i>Principles</i>, ed.
Gonner, p. 322.) And so when a proprietor sells corn to a consumer it is not of
the nature of an ordinary bargain where both parties gain something. The
consumer gets nothing in return for what he gives, <i>i.e.</i> for what he gives over
and above what it has cost to produce the corn. To get nothing in return for
something given is the kind of transaction that generally goes by the name of theft.</p>

<p>Ricardo soon finds a reply to the comfortable doctrine of Smith, that the
interests of the landlords are nowhere opposed to those of the rest of the community.
“The interest of the landlord is always opposed to that of the consumer
and manufacturer. Corn can be permanently at an advanced price only
because additional labour is necessary to produce it, because its cost of production
is increased. It is therefore for the interest of the landlord that the cost attending
the production of corn should be increased. This, however, is not the
interest of the consumer.… Neither is it the interest of the manufacturer
that corn should be at a high price, for the high price of corn will occasion high
wages, but will not raise the price of his commodity.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 322.)</p>

land is most fertile, where importation is least restricted, and where, through
agricultural improvements, productions can be multiplied without any increase
in the proportional quantity of labour, and where consequently the progress of
rent is slow.” (<i>Principles</i>, ed. Gonner, p. 54.) The contrast between fertile
lands, free exchange, and the development of agricultural science on the one
hand, and the growth of rent on the other, is very strikingly brought out in this
paragraph.</p>

of its price.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 55.) And he adds: “The clearly understanding of this
principle is, I am persuaded, of the utmost importance to the science of political
economy.” It is true that Smith, writing long before this time, had declared
that the “high rate of rent is the effect of price,” but he does not seem to have
attached any great importance to the remark.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_343" id="Footnote_343"></a><a href="#FNanchor_343"><span class="label">[343]</span></a> Ricardo wisely admits the possibility of confiscating this rent by means of
taxation, the reason for this being that “a tax on rent would affect rent only,
it would fall wholly on landlords and could not be shifted to any class of consumers.”
(<i>Principles</i>, ed. Gonner, p. 154.) And the argument which he
advances in proof of this, namely, that the tax could not be shifted, seems to
indicate that this particular kind of revenue is not quite as intangible as that of
some other classes in society. But his advocacy is somewhat restrained, for, as
he points out, it would be unjust to put all the burden of taxation upon the
shoulders of one class of the community. Rent is often the property of people
who, after years of toil, have invested their earnings in land. The original
injustice, if any, would thus be got rid of in the process of selling the land. This
might be a sufficient reason for indemnifying the expropriated, but it is not
enough to condemn expropriation altogether.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_345" id="Footnote_345"></a><a href="#FNanchor_345"><span class="label">[345]</span></a> Mr. Robert Thompson, in a paper read before the Royal Statistical Society
on December 17, 1907, has shown how the average rent per acre, valued at 11s. 2d.
in 1801-5, reached the figure of 20s. in 1841-45, and despite the abolition of
protection continued to rise up to 1872-77, when it reached a maximum of
29s. 4d. It then continued to fall until it reached the present amount of 20s.
The present figure is double what it was in Ricardo’s time, but considerable
deductions are necessary in view of the improvements made in the character of
the soil. Thompson, after making these deductions, puts the amount at 15s. 5d.,
leaving just 4s. 7d. for rent pure and simple. The 11s. for rent at the beginning
of the century covered something besides economic rent. Considerable deductions
are again necessary, but the amount of capital employed in agriculture was
much less then.</p>

<p>One seems justified in saying that in England and even in France and other
Protective countries the land has lost both in revenue and value during the
last quarter of the nineteenth century almost all that it had gained from the
time of Ricardo up till then. But is the recoil sufficient to justify Foville’s
description of Ricardo’s vaunted law as a pure myth? We think not. It has
the experience of seventy-five years behind it and of twenty-five years against it,
that is all. Anyone who would predict a further fall in rent would certainly be
running the risk of becoming a false prophet.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_349" id="Footnote_349"></a><a href="#FNanchor_349"><span class="label">[349]</span></a> This is a fundamental distinction upon which Ricardo is always insisting.
The greater or smaller quantity of labour employed in the production of corn
bears no necessary relation to the worker’s wages. The one is merely a question
of production, the other of distribution. The one is the task, the other the reward.
But some might ask if the Ricardian theory of value does not state that the
value of the product is determined by the quantity of labour necessary for
its production, that this value will be subsequently divided between capitalist
and worker, and that the greater this quantity the greater will be the share of each.
Labour’s share may increase, but not the labourer’s, for we must not forget that
when the price of corn goes up from 10s. to 20s. it is because the cultivation of
poorer lands requires twice the number of labourers demanded by the better kind
of land. Besides, it would be a strange thing to pay a man more as the work
becomes less remunerative. All that one could hope for would be that the workers
under the new conditions might be able to retain their old standard of life—that
is, might be able to purchase the same quantity of bread despite the rise in price.</p>

lower profits.”</p>

<p>“Thus in every case … profits are lowered … by a rise of wages.”</p>

proportionally larger share of the produce see note, p. 162.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_351" id="Footnote_351"></a><a href="#FNanchor_351"><span class="label">[351]</span></a> Ricardo does not deny this. Indeed, he lays stress upon the fact that he
is arguing on the assumption that the value produced remains the same. “I
have therefore made no allowance for the increasing price of the other necessaries,
besides food of the labourer; an increase which would be the consequence of the
increased value of the raw materials from which they are made, and which
would of course further increase wages and lower profits.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_352" id="Footnote_352"></a><a href="#FNanchor_352"><span class="label">[352]</span></a> But this only means a rise in the nominal or money wage. It does not
mean that the worker gets more corn; he only gets the same amount as before,
because the price of corn has gone up and it makes no difference whether the
man is paid in money or in kind.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_353" id="Footnote_353"></a><a href="#FNanchor_353"><span class="label">[353]</span></a> “For as soon as wages should be equal to the whole receipts of the farmer,
there must be an end of accumulation: for no capital can then yield any profit
whatever, and no additional labour can be demanded, and consequently population
will have reached its highest point.” (<i>Principles</i>, ed. Gonner, p. 67.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_354" id="Footnote_354"></a><a href="#FNanchor_354"><span class="label">[354]</span></a> When speaking of a reduction of capital’s share Ricardo frequently employs
the phrase “a lowering of the rate of profits,” or “a fall in the rate of profits.”
A fall in the rate is not necessarily synonymous with a reduction of capital’s
share, however. The rate of profit simply implies a certain proportion between
revenue and capital—5 per cent., for example; there is no suggestion of comparison
between the quantities drawn by capitalist and workers respectively.
Doubtless we must admit that when the rate of profit is diminished, <i>ceteris paribus</i>,
the part drawn by capital relatively to labour’s share also diminishes, but it is
clear that if the quantity of capital employed in any industry were to be doubled,
or the product halved, capital, even at the rate of 3 instead of 5 per cent., would
be drawing a more considerable share and leaving labour with less. Bastiat, as
we shall have to note, made the same mistake.</p>

that even if a belt of fertile land were added to this island of ours profits would still
keep up. Free Trade has added the illimitable zone of fertile land which Ricardo
dreamed of, with the result that both profits and rents have fallen.</p>

<p>In his essay <i>On Protection to Agriculture</i> (1822) he shows how Protection, by
forcing the cultivation of less fertile lands at home, raises the price of corn and
increases rents; and his demand was not for free importation, but for a reduction
of the duty to 10s. a quarter.</p>

to pay a subsidy to a foreign Power, money would not be exported whilst there
were any goods which could more cheaply discharge the payment.” (McCulloch’s

leagued against Napoleon were subsidised in this fashion, the exports exceeding
the imports by many millions. The indemnity of 5 milliards of francs paid by
France to Germany affords another illustration of the same truth.</p>

clearly visible in a host of other passages, especially in the vagueness of his
definitions. Labour in one place is defined as the source of all revenues (<i>ibid.</i>,
vol. i, p. 85); elsewhere, as the workers’ revenue as contrasted with interest and
rent (vol. i, pp. 96, 101, 110, 113, 114; vol. ii, p. 257, etc.). He never distinguishes
between national and private capital, and wages are sometimes treated
as capital, sometimes as revenue (p. 379). He constantly uses such vague terms
as “rich” and “poor” to designate capitalist and worker (vol. ii, chap. 5). In
his explanation of how the rate of interest is fixed he says that the strength of
the lenders of capital just balances the strength of the borrowers, and, as in all
other markets, they hit upon a proportional mean (vol. ii, p. 36). In a similar
fashion he is constantly confusing revenue in kind with money revenue.</p>

total product of this year against the total product of the preceding one” (p. 121).
Sismondi attached great importance to the distinction between the national
revenue and the annual product. “The confusion of the annual revenue with
the annual product casts a thick veil over the whole science. On the other hand,
all becomes clear and facts fall in with the theory as soon as one is separated from
the other.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 366-367.) It is he himself, on the contrary, who creates

October 1819. For J. B. Say see <a href="#Page_115">pp. 115-117</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to Ricardo, Sismondi relates that in the very year of his death he
had two or three conversations with him on this subject at Geneva. In the end
he seems to have accepted Ricardo’s point of view, but not without several
reservations. “We arrive then at Ricardo’s conclusion and find that when
circulation is complete (and having nowhere been arrested) production does
give rise to consumption”; but he adds: “This involves making an abstraction of
time and place, and of all those obstacles which might arrest this circulation.”</p>

<p>Sismondi defended his point of view against his three critics in two articles
reprinted at the end of the second edition of the <i>Nouveaux Principes</i>.</p>

the participation by all its citizens in the pleasures of life which the wealth represents.
Wealth and population in the abstract are no indication of a country’s
prosperity: they must in some way be related to one another before being
employed as the basis of comparison.” (<i>Nouveaux Principes</i>, vol i, p. 9.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_390" id="Footnote_390"></a><a href="#FNanchor_390"><span class="label">[390]</span></a> The unanimity is not quite absolute, however. Ricardo in the third edition
of his <i>Principles</i> added a chapter on machinery in which he admitted that he was
mistaken in the belief that machines after a short period always proved favourable
to the interests of the workers. He recognised that the worker might suffer,
for though the machine increases the net product of industry it frequently
diminishes the total product. He seemed to think that this might happen
frequently, but in reality it is quite exceptional.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_391" id="Footnote_391"></a><a href="#FNanchor_391"><span class="label">[391]</span></a> We may here recall the celebrated winch argument. Suppose, says
Sismondi, that England succeeded in tilling her fields and doing all the work
of her towns by means of steam power, so that her total products and revenue
remain the same as they are to-day, though her population is only equal to that
of the republic of Geneva. Is she to be regarded as being richer and more
prosperous? Ricardo would reply in the affirmative. Wealth is everything,
men nothing. Really, then, a single king, dwelling alone on the island, by merely
turning a winch might conceivably automatically perform all the work done in
England to-day. One can only reply to this argument by saying that long before
arriving at this state the community itself would have devised some machinery
for distributing the product between all its members. To suppose that a portion
of the population dies of hunger through want of employment while the other part
continues to manufacture the same quantity of goods as before is sufficiently
contradictory. But at bottom, disregarding the paradoxical form given it by
Sismondi, the question set by him is insoluble. What is the best equilibrium
between production and population? Are we to prefer a population rapidly
increasing in numbers, but making no advance in wealth, to a population which
is stationary or even decreasing, but rapidly advancing in wealth? Everyone is
free to choose for himself. Science gives us no criterion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_392" id="Footnote_392"></a><a href="#FNanchor_392"><span class="label">[392]</span></a> “We have said elsewhere, but think it essential to repeat it, that it is not the
perfection of machinery that is the real calamity, but the unjust distribution
of the goods produced. The more we are able to increase the quantity of goods
produced with a given quantity of labour, the more ought we to increase our
comforts or our leisure. Were the worker his own master, after accomplishing
in two hours with a machine a task which formerly took him twelve he would
then desist from toil, unless he had some new need or were able to make use
of a larger amount of products. It is our present organisation and the workman’s
servitude that has forced him to work not less but more hours, at the same
wage, and this despite the fact that machinery has increased his productive
powers.” (<i>Nouveaux Principes</i>, vol. ii, p. 318.) In this passage we have Sismondi’s
real opinion on the subject of machinery most clearly expressed.</p>

upon the passage by M. Aftalion in his otherwise excellent monograph, <i>L’Œuvre
économique de Simonde de Sismondi</i> (Paris, 1899), as well as from the view expressed
by M. Denis (<i>Histoire des Systèmes économiques</i>, vol. ii, p. 306). But Sismondi’s
text appears to us to leave no room for doubt. “As against land we might
combine the other two sources of wealth, life which enables a man to work and
capital which employs him. These two powers when united possess an expansive
characteristic, so that the labour which a worker puts in his work one year will
be greater than that put in the preceding year—upon the product of which the
worker will have supported himself. It is because of this surplus value [<i>mieux
value</i>], which increases as the arts and sciences are progressively applied to
industry, that society obtains a constant increment of wealth.” (<i>Nouveaux
Principes</i>, vol. i, p. 103.)</p>

co-operates with labour. And its possessor withholds from the worker the part
which the worker has produced beyond his cost of maintenance—as compensation
for the help which he has given him.” It is true that this proportion is a considerable
one. “The <i>entrepreneur</i> is bound to leave to the worker just enough to
keep him alive, reserving for himself all that the worker has produced over and
above this.” (P. 103.) But this is not a matter of necessity—a deduction from
the laws of value, as it is with Marx.</p>

never admits that population depends upon the means of subsistence; he holds
that it varies according to the will of the proprietor, who stimulates or retards it
according to his demand, but who is interested in its limitation in order to secure
for himself the maximum net product. “Population has never reached the limits
of possible subsistence, and probably it never will. But all those who desire the
subsistence have neither the means nor the right to extract it from the soil.
Those, on the contrary, to whom the laws give the monopoly of the land have
no interest in obtaining from it all the subsistence it might produce. In all
countries proprietors are opposed, and must be opposed, to any system of cultivation
which would tend merely to multiply the means of subsistence while
not increasing the revenue. Long before being arrested by the impossibility of
finding a country which produced more subsistence population would be checked
by the impossibility of finding the people to buy those means or to work and
bring them into being.” (<i>Nouveaux Principes</i>, vol. ii, pp. 269-270.)</p>

Sismondi’s attention for a long time. We find a suggestion of it in his first
work, <i>Le Tableau de l’Agriculture toscane</i> (Geneva, 1801), and though he does
not definitely take the side of the gross produce, he shows some leanings that
way. “Why is the gain of a single rich farmer considered more profitable for
a State than the miserable earnings of several thousand workers and peasants?”
The book, however, is a treatise on practical agriculture, and includes only a few
economic dicta. It is here that we have his beautiful description of his farm at
Val Chiuso (p. 219).</p>

corn for a market, so as to free the nation’s food from the fluctuations of that
market. Neither is he over-enthusiastic in his praise of the gross produce. He
recognises that the gradual growth of the gross produce might, in its way, be the
consequence of a state of suffering if population were to progress too rapidly
(<i>Nouveaux Principes</i>, vol. i, p. 153). This shows what a hesitating mind we are

disappear, and a great <i>entrepreneur</i> replaces hundreds of them whose total wealth
was never equal to his. Taken altogether, however, they consumed more than he
does. His costly luxury gives much less encouragement to industry than the
honest ease of the hundred homes which it has replaced.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 327). The
theory is more than doubtful. What we want to know is whether the demand
will remain the same in amount, not whether there will be no change in its
character—a contingency that need not result in a general crisis, but simply in a

of interest as he does to the growth of production or the increase of machinery.
“An increase of capital is desirable only when its employment can be increased
at the same time. But whenever the rate of interest is lowered it is a certain
sign that the employment of capital has proportionally diminished as compared
with the amount available; and this fall in the rate, which is always advantageous
to some people, is disadvantageous to others—some will have to be
content with smaller incomes and others with none at all.” (<i>Nouveaux Principes</i>,

<p><a name="Footnote_435" id="Footnote_435"></a><a href="#FNanchor_435"><span class="label">[435]</span></a> It was not intended that any reference should be made in this volume to
the doctrine of socialism before the opening of the nineteenth century, but the
question whether the French Revolution of 1789 was socialist in character or
simply middle-class, as the socialists of to-day would put it, has been so frequently
discussed that we cannot ignore it altogether.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the leaders of the Revolution—including Marat
even, who is wrongly regarded as a supporter of that agrarian law which he
condemned as fatal and erroneous—always showed unfailing respect for the
institution of private property. The confiscation of the property of the Church
and of the <i>émigré</i> nobles was a political and not an economic measure, and in
that respect is fairly comparable with the historic confiscation of the property
of Jews, Templars, Huguenots, and Irish, which in no case was inspired by merely
socialist motives. The confiscation of endowments—of goods belonging to legal
persons—was regarded as a means of defending individual or real property against
the encroachments of merely fictitious persons and the tyranny of the dead hand.
When it came to the abolition of feudal rights great care was taken to distinguish
the tenant’s rights of sovereignty, which were about to be abolished, from his proprietary
rights, which deserved the respect of everyone who recognised the legitimacy
of compensation. In practice the distinction proved of little importance.
Scores of people were ruined during those unfortunate months—some through mere
misfortune, others because of the muddle over the issue of assignats, and others,
again, because of the confiscation of rents; but the intention to respect the
rights of property remains indisputable still. It would seem that in this matter
the revolutionary leaders had come under the influence of the Physiocrats, whose
cult of property has already engaged our attention. And how easy it would be to
imagine a Physiocrat penning Article 17 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man
when it speaks of property as an inviolable, sacred right! But, on the other hand,
it is true that Rousseau in his article <i>Économie politique</i> speaks of the rights of
property as the most sacred of the citizen’s rights.</p>

<p>It was not only on the question of property that the revolutionists of 1789
showed themselves anti-socialist. They were also anti-socialist in the sense
that they paid no attention to class war and ignored the antagonism that exists
between capitalists and workers. All were to be treated as citizens and brothers,
all were equal and alike.</p>

<p>However, those who claim the most intimate connection with the spirit of the
Revolution remain undismayed by such considerations. They endeavour to
show that the Revolution was not quite so conservative nor so completely
individualistic as is generally supposed, and after diligent search they claim to
have discovered certain decrees bearing unmistakable traces of socialism. But
a much more general practice is to plead extenuating circumstances. “Are we
to demand that the social problems which appeared fifty years afterwards, when
industry had revolutionised the relations of capital and labour, should have
been solved at the end of the eighteenth century? It would have been worse
than useless for the men of 1789 and 1793 to try to regulate such things in
advance.” (Aulard, Address to Students, April 21, 1893. Cf. his <i>Histoire politique
de la Révolution</i>, chap. 8, paragraph entitled “<i>Le Socialisme</i>.”)</p>

<p>We must not lose sight of the communist plot hatched by François Babeuf
during the period of the Revolution. But in this case, at any rate, the exception
proves the rule, for, despite the fact that Babeuf had assumed the suggestive
name of Gaius Gracchus, he found little sympathy among the men of the Convention,
even in La Montagne, and he was condemned and executed by order
of the Directory. Babeuf’s plot is interesting, if only as an anticipatory
protest of revolutionary socialism against <i>bourgeois</i> revolution. Cf. Aulard,
<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 627.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_436" id="Footnote_436"></a><a href="#FNanchor_436"><span class="label">[436]</span></a> Not to speak of celebrated Utopians like Plato, More, and Campanella, a
number of writers who have been minutely studied by Lichtenberger undertook
to supply such criticism in the eighteenth century. Morelly, Mably, Brissot,
and Meslier the <i>curé</i> in France, and Godwin in England, attacked the institution
of property with becoming vigour. Babeuf, who in 1797 suffered death for his
attempt to establish a community of equals, has left us a summary of their
theories. But the Saint-Simonians owe them nothing in the way of inspiration.
Eighteenth-century socialism was essentially equalitarian. What aroused the
anger of the eighteenth-century writers most of all was the inequality of pleasure
and of well-being, for which they held the institution of private property responsible.
“If men have the same needs and the same faculties they ought to be
given the same material and the same intellectual opportunities,” says the
<i>Manifeste des Égaux</i>. But the Saint-Simonians recognise neither equality of
needs nor of faculties, and they are particularly anxious not to be classed
along with the Babeuvistes—the champions of the agrarian law. Their
socialism, which is founded upon the right to the whole produce of labour
and would apportion wages according to capacity, aims neither at equality nor
uniformity.</p>

<p>The Saint-Simonians seem to have remained in ignorance of the socialist
theories of their contemporaries, the French Fourier and the English Thompson
and Owen. Fourier’s work only became known to Enfantin after his own
economic doctrine had been formulated. Saint-Simon and Bazard appear never
to have read him. It is probable that Enfantin only became aware of Fourier’s
writings after 1829, and when he did he interested himself merely in those that
dealt with free love and the theory of passions. As Bourgin put it: “If Fourier
did anything at all, he has rather hastened the decomposition of Saint-Simonism.”
(Henry Bourgin, <i>Fourier</i>, p. 419; Paris, 1905.)</p>

<p>The English socialists are never as much as mentioned. The Ricardian
doctrine of labour-value, which is the basis of Thompson’s theory and of Owen’s,
and later still of that of Marx, seems never to have become known to them. “Questions
of value, price, and production, which demand no fundamental knowledge
either of the composition or the organisation of society,” are treated as so many
details (<i>Le Producteur</i>, vol. iv, p. 388). Their doctrine is primarily social, containing
only occasional allusions to political economy. Enfantin is careful to
distinguish between Quesnay and his school and Smith or Say. The Physiocrats
gave a social character to their doctrine, which the economists wrongfully neglected
to develop. Aug. Comte, in the fourth volume of the <i>Cours de Philosophie</i>, has
criticised political economy in almost identical terms, which affords an additional
proof of his indebtedness to Saint-Simonism.</p>

recognise that nearly all Government measures which have presumed to influence
social prosperity have simply proved harmful. Hence people have come to the
conclusion that the best way in which a Government can further the well-being
of society is by letting it alone. But this method of looking at the question,
however just it may seem when we consider it in relation to the present political
system, is evidently false when it is adopted as a general principle. The impression
will remain, however, until we succeed in establishing another political
order.” (<i>L’Organisateur, Œuvres</i>, vol. iv, p. 201.)</p>

<p>Later on the Saint-Simonians abandoned this idea and demanded Governmental
control of all social relations. “Far from admitting that the directive
control of Government in social matters ought to be restricted, we believe that
it ought to be extended until it includes every kind of social activity. Moreover,
we believe that it should always be exercised, for society to us seems a veritable
hierarchy.” (<i>Doctrine de Saint-Simon, Exposition, Deuxième Année</i>, p. 108;

the customary rights of the factory. Not only will socialism stand to benefit
by the existence of the industrial system which has been built up by capital
and science upon the basis of technical development, but it will gain even more
from that spirit of co-operation which has long been a feature of factory life,
drawing out the best energy and the best skill of the workman.” Earlier in the
same volume he writes: “Everything will proceed in an orderly, economical
fashion, just like a factory.” (G. Sorel, <i>Le Syndicalisme révolutionnaire</i>, in <i>Le
Mouvement socialiste</i>, November 1 and 15, 1905.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_463" id="Footnote_463"></a><a href="#FNanchor_463"><span class="label">[463]</span></a> Saint-Simon often quotes Say and Smith with distinct approval. But he
charges Say with the separation of politics from economics instead of merging
the former in the latter, and with inability to realise to the full extent what he
“dimly saw, as it were, in spite of himself, namely, that political economy
is the one true foundation of politics.” (<i>Lettres à un Américain, Œuvres</i>, vol. ii,
p. 185.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_464" id="Footnote_464"></a><a href="#FNanchor_464"><span class="label">[464]</span></a> Saint-Simon is classed among the socialists for two reasons: (1) the interest
he takes in the condition of the poor; (2) his opinions concerning the necessity
for reforming the institution of private property. But none of the texts that
are generally quoted seem to have the significance that is occasionally given
them. With regard to the first point, a celebrated passage from the <i>Nouveau
Christianisme</i> is the one usually quoted: “Society should be organised in such
a fashion as to secure the greatest advantage for the greatest number. The
object of all its labours and activities should be the promptest, completest amelioration
possible of the moral and physical condition of the most numerous class.”
(<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. vii, pp. 108-109.) Already in his <i>Système industriel</i> Saint-Simon had
said that the direct object which he had in view was to better the lot of that
class that had no other means of existence than the labour of its own right arm.
(<i>Ibid.</i>, vol. vi, p. 81.) But is this not just the old Benthamite formula—the
greatest good of the greatest number? Besides, how does Saint-Simon propose
to secure all this? By giving the workers more power? Not at all. “The
problem of social organisation must be solved for the people. The people themselves
are passive and listless and must be discounted in any consideration of the
question. The best way is to entrust public administration to the care of the
industrial chiefs, who will always directly attempt to give the widest possible
scope to their undertakings, with the result that their efforts in this direction
will lead to the maximum expansion of the amount of work executed by the
mass of the people.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, vol. vi, pp. 82-83.) A Liberal economist would
hardly have expressed it otherwise.</p>

<p>As to the question of private property, Saint-Simon certainly regarded its
transformation as at least possible. This is seen in a number of passages.
“Property should be reconstituted and established upon a foundation that
might prove more favourable for production,” says he in <i>L’Organisateur</i>.
(<i>Ibid.</i>, vol. iv, p. 59.) Elsewhere, in a letter written to the editor of the <i>Journal
général de la France</i>, he mentions the fact that he is occupied with the development
of the following ideas: (1) That the law establishing the right of private
property is the most important of all, seeing that it is the basis of our social
edifice; (2) the institution of private property ought to be constituted in such a
fashion that the possessors may be stimulated to make the best possible use
of it. (<i>Ibid.</i>, vol. iii, pp. 43-44.) In his <i>Lettres à un Américain</i> he gives the
following résumé of the principles which underlie the work of J. B. Say (an
incidental proof of his attachment to the Liberal economists): “The production
of useful objects is the only positive, reasonable aim which political societies can
propose for themselves, and consequently the principle of respect for production
and producers is a much more fruitful one than the other principle of respect for
property and proprietors.” (<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. ii, pp. 186-187.) But all that this
seems to us to imply is that the utility of property constitutes its legality and that
it should be organised with a view to social utility. Admitting that he did conceive
of the necessity of a reform of property, it does not appear that he intended
this to mean anything beyond a reform of landed property. We have already
seen how he regarded capital as a kind of social outlay which demanded remuneration.
The following passage bears eloquent testimony to his respect for movable
property: “Wealth, generally speaking, affords a proof of the manufacturers’
ability even where that wealth is derived from inherited fortune, whereas in
the other classes of society it is apparently true to say that the richer are inferior
in capacity to those who have received less education but have a smaller fortune.
This is a truth that must play an important part in positive politics.” (<i>Syst.
indust., Œuvres</i>, vol. v, p. 49, note.)</p>

1829. Our quotations are taken from the second edition (Paris, 1830). One
ought to mention, in addition to these, the articles contributed by Enfantin to
<i>Le Globe</i> and republished under the title of <i>Économie politique et Politique</i>, in
one volume (2nd ed., 1832). But none of these articles is as interesting as the

of Bazard and was prepared for the press by his disciples—Hippolyte Carnot
among others—most of the economic ideas contained in it must be attributed to
Enfantin. Enfantin also was responsible for the majority of the economic
articles that appeared in <i>Le Producteur</i>. But the doctrine set forth in <i>Le
Producteur</i> differs considerably from that expounded in the <i>Exposition</i>. Interest
and rent are subjected to severe criticism as tributes paid to idleness by industry.
Inheritance, on the other hand, though treated with scant sympathy, is not
condemned. A lowering of the rate of interest would, Enfantin thinks, help
to enfranchise the workers, and a sound credit system would solve the greatest
of modern problems—that is, it would reconcile workers and idlers, “whose
interests will never again be confused with the general interest, inasmuch as
the possession of the fruits of past labour will no longer constitute a claim to
the enjoyment of the benefits of labour in the present or future.” (<i>Le Producteur</i>,
vol. ii, p. 124.) These ideas are more fully developed in the <i>Exposition</i>.</p>

by Sismondi, the Saint-Simonians, and Marx respectively as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Sismondi thinks that the worker is exploited whenever he is not paid a
wage sufficient to enable him to lead a decent existence. Unearned income seems
quite legitimate, however.</p>

<p>(2) Exploitation exists, in the opinion of the Saint-Simonians, whenever a
part of the material produce raised by labour is devoted to the remuneration of
proprietors through the operation of ordinary social factors.</p>

<p>(3) Marx speaks of exploitation whenever a portion of the produce of labour
is devoted to the remuneration of capital either through the existence of social
institutions or the operation of the laws of exchange.</p>

ignoring for the time being the somewhat narrow interpretation usually placed
upon that word. In the first place, the system would comprise a central bank,
which would directly represent the Government. This bank would be the
depository for every kind of wealth, of all funds for productive purposes and
all instruments of labour—in a word, it would include everything that is to-day
comprised within the term ‘private property.’ Depending upon this central
bank would be other banks of a secondary character, which would be, as it were,
a prolongation of the former and would supply it with the means of coming into
touch with the principal localities, informing the central institution as to their
particular needs and their productive ability. Within the area circumscribed
for these banks would be other banks of a more specialised character still, covering
a less extensive field and including within their ambit the tenderer branches of
the industrial tree. All wants would be finally focused in the central bank and
all effort would radiate from it.” (<i>Doctrine</i>, pp. 206-207.) The idea is probably
Enfantin’s, for there is an exposition of the same idea in <i>Le Producteur</i>,

remarks that in political matters the jurists form a connecting link between
feudal government on the one hand and industrial government on the other,
just as the metaphysicians are intermediate between the theological and the
scientific <i>régimes</i>. In a note which he adds he states his position still more
clearly (<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. v, p. 9). It is true that the <i>Système industriel</i> dates from
1821, and is consequently subsequent to the beginning of the friendly relations
between Comte and Saint-Simon. But textual evidence, however precise,
cannot decide the question of the reciprocal influence which these two Messiahs
exercised upon one another. A similar idea had already found expression in

and social instability. The former periods are essentially religious, the latter
selfish. Reform and revolution are the modern manifestations of the critical

institutions are just the expression of their thoughts.” (<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. iii, p. 31.)
“Philosophy,” he remarks elsewhere, “is responsible for the creation of all the
more important political institutions. No other power would have the strength
necessary to check the action of those that have already become antiquated
or to set up others more in conformity with a new doctrine.” (<i>Syst. indust.</i>,
<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. v, p. 167.) He further insists upon the part which philanthropists
may play in the creation of a new society. “One truth,” he writes, “that has
been established in the course of human progress is this: a disinterested desire
for the general well-being of the community is a more effective instrument of
political improvement than the conscious self-regarding action of the classes
for which these changes will prove most beneficial. In a word, experience seems
to show that those who should naturally be most interested in the establishment
of a new order of things are not those who show the greatest desire to bring it
about.” (<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. vi, p. 120.) It would be difficult to imagine a neater
refutation of Marxian ideas, especially the contention that the emancipation of
the workers can only come from the workers themselves.</p>

“All questions of political economy should be linked together by a common
principle, and in order to judge of the social utility of a measure or idea in
economics it is absolutely necessary to consider whether this idea or measure is
directly advantageous to the workers or whether it indirectly contributes to the
amelioration of their lot by discrediting idleness.” It is a pleasure to be able to
concur in the opinion expressed by M. Halévy in his article on Saint-Simon
(<i>Revue du Mois</i> for December 1907), in which he maintains that this idea is the
distinctive trait of Saint-Simon’s socialism. We have already called attention
to another feature that seems to us equally important, namely, the suggested
substitution of industrial administration for political government.</p>

is not <i>equality</i> in rank or possessions, is not <i>community of goods</i>, but full, complete,
unrestrained co-operation on the part of all the members for every purpose
of social life.” Fourier writes in a similar strain: “Association holds the secret
of the union of interests.” (<i>Assoc. domestique</i>, vol. i, p. 133.) Elsewhere he

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_514" id="Footnote_514"></a><a href="#FNanchor_514"><span class="label">[514]</span></a> It is quite possible that Owen regarded the term as his own invention, but
we now know that it had been previously employed by Pierre Leroux, the French
socialist. The publication of Owen’s <i>What is Socialism?</i> in 1841, however, is
the earliest instance of the term being employed as the title of a book.</p>

<p>Owen lived an extremely active life, and died in 1857 at the advanced age
of eighty-seven. Of Welsh artisan descent, he began life as an apprentice in a
cotton factory, setting up as a master spinner on his own account with a capital
of £100, which he had borrowed from his father. His rise was very rapid, and at
the age of thirty he found himself co-proprietor and director of the New Lanark
Mills. It was then that he first made a name for himself by his technical improvements
and his model dwellings for his workmen. It was at this period
that his ideas on education also took shape. By and by it became the fashion
to make a pilgrimage to view the factory at New Lanark, and among the visitors
were several very distinguished people. His correspondents also included more
than one royal personage. Among these we may specially mention the King
of Prussia, who sought his advice on the question of education, and the King of
Holland, who consulted him on the question of charity.</p>

<p>The crisis of 1815 revealed to Owen the serious defects in the economic order,
and this marks the beginning of the second period of his life, when he dabbled
in communal experiments. In 1825 he founded the colony of New Harmony
in Indiana, and the same year witnessed the establishment of another colony
at Orbiston, in Scotland. But these lasted only for a few years. In 1832 we
have the National Equitable Labour Exchange, which was not much more
successful.</p>

<p>Owen, sixty-three years of age, and thoroughly disappointed with his experiments,
but as convinced as ever of the truth of his doctrines, entered now upon
the third period of his life, which, as it happened, was to be a fairly long one.
This period was to be devoted wholly to propagating the gospel of the New
Moral World—<i>The New Moral World</i> being the title of his chief work and of
the newspaper which he first published towards the end of 1834. He took an
active part in the Trade Union movement, but does not seem to have been
much interested in the co-operative experiments which were started by the
Rochdale Pioneers in 1844, although curiously enough this is his chief claim
to fame.</p>

<p>Owen was in no sense a <i>littérateur</i>, being essentially a man of affairs, and we
are not surprised to find that the number of books which he has left behind him
is small. But he was an indefatigable lecturer, and wrote a good deal for the
press. We must confess, however, that it is not easy, as we read his addresses
and articles to-day, to account for the wonderful contemporary success which
they had.</p>

<p>There is an excellent French work by Dolléans dealing with his life and
doctrines (1907). The best English life, that of Podmore, is unfortunately out

<p><a name="Footnote_515" id="Footnote_515"></a><a href="#FNanchor_515"><span class="label">[515]</span></a> To his fellow-employers who complained of his almost revolutionary
proposals Owen made reply as follows—and his words are quite as true now as
they were then: “Experience must have taught you the difference between an
efficiently equipped factory with its machinery always clean and in good working
order and one in which the machinery is filthy and out of repair and working
only with the greatest amount of friction. Now if the care which you bestow
upon machinery can give you such excellent results, may you not expect equally
good results from care spent upon human beings, with their infinitely superior
structure? Is it not quite natural to conclude that these infinitely more delicate
and complex mechanisms will also increase in force and efficiency and will be
really much more economical if they are kept in good working condition and
treated with a certain measure of kindness? Such kindness would do much to
remove the mental friction and irritation which always results whenever the
nourishment is insufficient to keep the body in full productive efficiency, as well
as to arrest deterioration and to prevent premature death.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_516" id="Footnote_516"></a><a href="#FNanchor_516"><span class="label">[516]</span></a> Education is given a very prominent place in Owen’s system, and once
we accept his philosophy we realise what an important place it was really
bound to have. Education was to make men, just as boots and caps are
made. Were it not altogether foreign to our purpose it would be interesting
to compare his educational ideals with those of Rousseau as outlined in
<i>Émile</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_518" id="Footnote_518"></a><a href="#FNanchor_518"><span class="label">[518]</span></a> On the other hand, Owen had great influence with the working classes, and
this he attributed to the fact that, “freed from all religious prejudice, he was
able to look upon men and human nature in general with infinite charity, and
in that light men no longer seemed responsible for their actions.” (Quoted by

<p><a name="Footnote_520" id="Footnote_520"></a><a href="#FNanchor_520"><span class="label">[520]</span></a> On the other hand, there is this objection:</p>

<p>Whenever profit forms a part of cost of production it is impossible to distinguish
it from interest. In that case it is true that even perfect competition
would not do away with profit, since it will only reduce the price to the level of
cost of production. In that case profit cannot be said to be either unjust or
parasitic, for the product is sold exactly for what it cost.</p>

<p>When profit does not enter into cost of production there is no possibility of
confusing it with interest. It is simply the difference between the sale price
and the cost of replacing the article. In this it is certainly parasitic, and would
disappear under a <i>régime</i> of perfect competition, which must to some extent
destroy the monopoly upon which such profit rests.</p>

<p>But the distinction between profit and interest was not known in Owen’s
time, and Owen would have said that they are both one, and that if profit
occasionally claims a share in the cost of production with a view to defying
competition it has no right to any such refuge, for cost of production should
consist of nothing but the value of labour and the wear and tear of capital.
Accordingly it ought to be got rid of altogether.</p>

he regarded this merely as a compromise, and that he looked forward to a
time when the establishment of a communistic association with a new environment
would lead to a complete solution of the problem. He began in the New
Harmony colony by making <i>pro rata</i> payment for the work done, but the object
was to arrive gradually at a state of complete equality where no distinction
was to be made between the service rendered or the labour given—with the
result that the colony was extinct in six months.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_523" id="Footnote_523"></a><a href="#FNanchor_523"><span class="label">[523]</span></a> The Labour Exchange, which was opened in September 1832, at first enjoyed
a slight measure of success. There were 840 members, and they even went the
length of establishing a few branches. Among the chief causes of the failure of
the scheme the following may be enumerated:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The associates, being themselves allowed to state the value of their
products, naturally exaggerated, and it became necessary to relieve them of a
task which depended entirely upon their honour, and to place the valuation in
the hands of experts. But these experts, who were not at all versed in Owen’s
philosophy, valued the goods in money in the ordinary way, and then expressed
those values in labour notes at the rate of 6<i>d.</i> for every hour’s work. It could
hardly have been done on any other plan. But it was none the less true that
Owen’s system was in this way inverted, for instead of the labour standard
determining the selling value of the product, the money value of the product
determined the value of the labour.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) As soon as the society began to attract members who were not quite as
conscientious as those who first joined it, the Exchange was flooded with goods
that were really unsaleable. But for the notes received in exchange for these
the authorities would be forced to give goods which possessed a real value,
that is, goods which had been honestly marked, and which commanded a good
price, with the result that in the long run there would be nothing left in the
depot except worthless products. In short, the Exchange would be reduced to
buying goods which cost more than they were worth, and selling goods that
really cost less than they were worth.</p>

<p>Since the notes were not in any way registered, any one, whether a member
of the society or not, could buy and sell them in the ordinary way and make a
handsome profit out of the transaction. Three hundred London tradesmen
did this by offering to take labour notes in payment for merchandise. They
soon emptied the Exchange, and when they saw that nothing valuable was left
they stopped taking the notes, and the trick was done.</p>

<p>M. Denis very aptly points out that the Exchange was really of not much
use to the wage-earner, who was not even allowed to own what he had produced.
There is some doubt after all as to whether the system would prove quite
successful in abolishing the wage-earners.</p>

organised and federated, with large central depots at their command, will not
take up this project once again—that is, will not try to dispense with money in
their commercial transactions. They will certainly keep an eye on that problem.</p>

once more a story told by more than one eminent economist, attributing to him
the statement that the members of the Phalanstère would all be endowed with a
tail with an eye at the end of it. The caricaturists of the period—“Cham,” for
example—represent them in that fashion. The legend doubtless grew out of the
following passage from his works, which is fantastic enough, as everybody will
admit. After pointing out that the inhabitants of other planets have several
limbs which we do not possess, he proceeds: “There is one limb especially which
we have not, and which possesses the following very useful characteristics. It
acts as a support against falling, it is a powerful means of defence, a superb
ornament of gigantic force and wonderful dexterity, and gives a finish as well
as lending support to every bodily movement.” (<i>Fausse Industrie</i>, vol. ii, p. 5.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_538" id="Footnote_538"></a><a href="#FNanchor_538"><span class="label">[538]</span></a> The system of integral association proposed by Fourier, including both
co-operative production and co-operative distribution, will be better understood
if we look at the facts of the present situation.</p>

<p>On the one hand we have co-operative associations of producers who are not
particularly anxious that their products should be distributed among themselves;
they simply produce the goods with a view to selling them and making a profit
out of the transaction. On the other hand, the distributing societies simply aim
at giving their members certain advantages, such as cheaper goods, but they
make no attempt to produce the goods which they need.</p>

<p>In countries where co-operative societies are properly organised, as they
are in England, for example, many of these societies have undertaken to produce
at least a part of what they consume, and some of them have even acquired
small estates for the purpose; but only a small proportion of the employees are
members of the societies, with the result that their position is not very different
from that of other working men. One understands the difficulty of grouping
people in this way. But if the associations are to live it is absolutely necessary
that they should produce what they require under conditions that are more
favourable than those of ordinary producers; in a word, that they should be
able to create a kind of new economic environment.</p>

<p>Even in the colonies one does not find many instances of vigorous associations
of this kind.</p>

We must also draw attention to his suggestion for co-operative banks, where
agriculturists could bring their harvest and obtain money in exchange for it—a
rough model of the agricultural credit banks. But he only regarded this as a
step towards the Phalanstère.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_542" id="Footnote_542"></a><a href="#FNanchor_542"><span class="label">[542]</span></a> The kinds of labour which Fourier selects as examples are always connected
with fruit-growing—cherry orchards, pear orchards, etc. Fruit and flowers
have a very important place in his writings. He seems to have anticipated the
fruit-growing rancher of California.</p>

<p>Without stopping to examine some of the more solid reasons—which unfortunately
are buried beneath a great deal of rubbish—why fruit-growing should
take the place of agriculture, we must just recall the curious fact that he was
always emphasising the superiority of sugar and preserves over bread, and
pointed to the “divine instinct” by which children are enabled to discover
this. The suggestion was ridiculed at the time, but is to-day confirmed by
some of the most eminent doctors and teachers of hygiene.</p>

Protection to be the outcome of international hatred (<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. iii,

one aim and that its interests were common, and consequently that each individual
in his social connection must be viewed as one of a company of workers” (<i>Lettres
à un Americaine, Œuvres</i>, vol. ii, pp. 186-187). The Saint-Simonians never
touched upon the question directly, but it is quite clear that Protective rights
were to have no place in the universal association of which they dreamt. According
to Fourier, there was to be the completest liberty in the circulation of goods
among the Phalanstères all the world over. (<i>Cf.</i> Bourgin, <i>Fourier</i>, pp. 326-329;

reputation which he subsequently achieved was not based upon this part of the
book. Louis Say (1774-1840) was a brother of J. B. Say. He published a
number of works, now quite forgotten, in which he criticised several doctrines
upheld by his brother, whose displeasure he thus incurred. We refer to his last
work, <i>Études sur la Richesse des Nations et Réfutation des principales Erreurs en
Économie politique</i> (1836), for this is the work to which List alludes. It is
probable that Louis Say’s name would have remained in oblivion but for
List. Richelot, in his translation of List (second edition, p. 477), quotes some of
the more important passages of Say’s book.</p>

advantages—the material profit existing at the moment. It is not a very happy
phrase, and it would be a great mistake to take it literally or to attach great
importance to it. In his <i>Letters to Ingersoll</i>, p. 186, he gives expression to the
same idea by saying that Smith’s school had in view “the exchange of one
material good for another,” and that its concern was chiefly with “such exchanged
goods rather than with productive forces.” We note that List never speaks of
Ricardo, but only of Smith and Say, whose works alone he seems to have read.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_575" id="Footnote_575"></a><a href="#FNanchor_575"><span class="label">[575]</span></a> It was the example of England that gave List the idea, but the whole conception
is based upon a historical error. England possessed a navy, had founded
colonies and developed her international trade long before she became a manufacturing
nation. Since the time of List various categories of national development
have been proposed. Hildebrand speaks of periods of natural economy,
of money economy, and of credit economy (<i>Jahrbücher für National Oekonomie</i>,
vol. ii, pp. 1-24). Bücher proposed the periods of domestic economy, of
town economy, and of national economy as a substitute (<i>Die Entstehung der
Volkswirtschaft</i>, 3rd ed., p. 108). Sombart, in his turn, has very justly
criticised this classification in his book <i>Der moderne Kapitalismus</i> (vol. i, p. 51;
Leipzig, 1902). But would that which he proposes himself be much better?</p>

<p>No one, we believe, has as yet remarked that List borrowed this enumeration
of the different economic states, almost word for word, from Adam Smith.
In chap. 5 of Book II, speaking of the various employments of capital, Smith
clearly distinguished between three stages of evolution—the agricultural state,
the agricultural-manufacturing, and the agricultural-manufacturing-commercial.
Smith considered that this last stage was the most desirable, but in his opinion its
realisation must depend upon the natural course of things.</p>

political economy. It would be well if we were rid of it altogether. What
controversies have not raged around the ideas of a normal wage or a normal
price! One of the chief merits of the Mathematical school lies in the success
with which it has effected the substitution of the idea of an equilibrium price.
The idea of a normal nation is about as vague as that of a normal wage, and
it is curious that our author describes as normal a whole collection of characteristics
which, according to his own account, were at the moment when he
wrote only realised by one nation, namely, England.</p>

of by Smith, as is proved by the following passages: “The riches and, so far as
power depends upon riches, the power of every country must always be in proportion
to the value of its annual produce.… But the great object of the
political economy of every country is to increase the riches and power of that
country.” (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book II, chap. 5; Cannan’s edition, vol. i, p. 351.)</p>

forces; but the distinction is by no means a happy one. For a policy which
aims at encouraging productive forces has no other way of demonstrating its
superiority than by showing an increase of exchange value. The two notions
are not opposed to one another, and in reckoning a nation’s wealth we must
take some account of its present state as well as of its future resources. In his
<i>Letters to Ingersoll</i> (<i>cf.</i> Letter IV, referred to above) he distinguishes between
“natural and intellectual capital” on the one hand and “material productive
capital” on the other (Adam Smith’s idea of capital). “The productive powers
of the nation depend not only upon the latter, but also and chiefly upon the
former.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_582" id="Footnote_582"></a><a href="#FNanchor_582"><span class="label">[582]</span></a> Unjustly as we think, for on more than one occasion Smith did take
account of moral forces. He dated the prosperity of English agriculture from
the time when farmers were freed from their long servitude and became henceforth
independent of the proprietors. He remarks that towns attain prosperity
quicker than the country, because a regular government is earlier established there.
“The best effect which commerce and manufactures have is the gradual introduction
and establishment of order and good government, and with them the
liberty and security of individuals among the inhabitants of the country. This,
though it has been the least observed, is by far the most important of their effects.
Mr. Hume is the only writer who so far as I know has hitherto taken notice of it.”
(Book III, chap. 4; Cannan, vol i, p. 383.) Speaking of the American colonies,
Smith (Cannan, vol. ii, p. 73) makes the remark that although their fertility is
inferior to the Spanish, Portuguese, and the French colonies, “the political
institutions of the English colonies have been more favourable to the improvement
and cultivation of this land than those of any of the other three nations.”
How could List have forgotten the celebrated passage in which Smith attributes
the prosperity of Great Britain largely to its legal system, which guarantees to
each individual the fruits of his toil and which must be reckoned among the definitive
achievements of the Revolution of 1688? “That security which the laws in
Great Britain give to every man that he shall enjoy the fruits of his own labour is
alone sufficient to make any country flourish, notwithstanding these and twenty
other absurd regulations of commerce; and this security was perfected much
about the same time that the bounty was established.” (Book IV, chap. 5;
Cannan, vol. ii, pp. 42-43.)</p>

cost of production of a manufactured good depends very largely upon the
quantity produced—that is, upon the operation of the law of increasing returns.
This law exercises considerable influence upon the rise and fall of manufacturing
power.… An English manufacturer producing for the home market has a
regular sale of 10,000 yards at 6 dollars a yard.… His expenses being thus
guaranteed by his sales in the home market, the cost of producing a further
quantity of 10,000 yards for the foreign market will be considerably reduced
and would yield him a profit even were he to sell for 3 or 4 dollars a yard. And
even though he should not be making any profit just then, he can feel pretty
confident about the future when he has ruined the foreign producer and driven
him out of the field altogether.” List thinks that this shows how impossible it
is for manufacturers in a new country without any measure of protection to
compete with other countries whose industry is better established. But this is
one of the arguments that has been most frequently used by British manufacturers
in recent years in demanding protection against American competition.
We would like to know what List would have thought of this.</p>

that “it would be a further error if France, after her manufacturing

according to Bastable (<i>Commerce of Nations</i>, 6th ed., London, 1912, pp. 120,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_594" id="Footnote_594"></a><a href="#FNanchor_594"><span class="label">[594]</span></a> It is very probable that List had read the work of another American Protectionist,
Daniel Raymond, whose <i>Thoughts on Political Economy</i> appeared in
1820 and ran into four editions (cf. <i>Daniel Raymond</i>, by Charles Patrick Neill,
Baltimore, 1897). This seems to be the opinion of the majority of writers who
during the last few years have especially concerned themselves with the study
of List’s opinions (Miss Hirst, in her <i>Life of Friedrich List</i>, and M. Curt Kohler
in his book <i>Problematisches zu Friedrich List</i>, Leipzig, 1909). But to regard
Raymond as his only inspirer, as is done by Rambaud in his <i>Histoire des Doctrines</i>,
seems to us mere exaggeration. Apart from the facts that Raymond’s ideas
are not particularly original and that List had lived some years in America
in a Protectionist environment, List never quotes him at all. On the other
hand, he frequently and enthusiastically refers to both Dupin and Chaptal
in his <i>Letters to Ingersoll</i>. The expression “productive forces” was probably
borrowed from Baron Dupin’s <i>Situation progressive des Forces de la France</i>
(Paris, 1827), which opens with the following words: “This forms an introduction
to a work entitled <i>The Productive and Commercial Forces of France</i>.
By <i>productive forces</i> I mean the combined forces of men, animals, and nature
applied to the work of agriculture, of industry, or of commerce.” Again, the
idea of protecting infant industries is very neatly put by Chaptal. On p. xlvi
of the introduction to his <i>De l’Industrie français</i> (published in 1819) we meet with
the following words: “It does not require much reflection to be convinced of the
fact that something more than mere desire is needed to overcome the natural
obstacles in the way of the development of industry. Everywhere we feel that
‘infant industries’ cannot struggle against older establishments cemented by
time, supported by much capital, freed from worry and carried on by a number of
trained, skilled workmen, without having recourse to prohibition in order to overcome
the competition of foreign industries.”</p>

<p>It is certain that List, during his first stay in France, had read these two
authors, and had there found a confirmation of his own Protectionist ideas. It
is not less certain, from a letter written by him in April 1825 (quoted by Miss Hirst,
p. 33), that he was converted before going to America, but that he expected to find
some new arguments there which would strengthen him in his opposition to
Smith. Marx’s assertion made in his <i>Theorien über den Mehrwerth</i>, vol. i, p. 339
(published by Kautsky, Stuttgart, 1905), that List’s principal source of inspiration
was Ferrier (<i>Du Gouvernement considéré dans ses Rapports avec le Commerce</i>, Paris,
1805) has not the slightest foundation. Neither has the attempt to credit Adam
Müller with being the real author of the conception of a national system of political
economy. List, we know, was acquainted with Müller, a Catholic writer
who wished for the restoration of the feudal system. But to be a German
writer in the Germany of the nineteenth century was quite enough to imbue
one with the idea of nationality. Moreover, Protectionists’ arguments are
extremely limited in number, so that they do not differ very much from one
epoch to another, and it is a comparatively easy task to find some precursors
of Friedrich List.</p>

List’s day was in greater need of Protection than the Germany of to-day. Indeed,
if we accept Chaptal’s view, we may well deny this, for, writing in 1819, he said
that Saxony occupied a place in the front rank of European nations in the matter
of industry. Speaking of Prussia, he declared that the industry of Aix-la-Chapelle
alone was enough to establish the fame of any nation (<i>De l’Industrie française</i>,

experience, and many workmen are required, and whose products belong to the
category of the first necessaries of life and consequently are of the greatest importance
as regards their total value as well as regards national independence
(as, for example, cotton, woollen, and linen manufactures, etc.). If these main
branches are suitably protected and developed, all other less important branches
of manufacture will rise up around them under a less degree of protection.”

perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country. The superiority of one

imports and exports. But he did not favour the Mercantilist theory of the
balance of trade; on the contrary, he regarded that as definitely condemned
(p. 218). He regarded the question from a special point of view, that of monetary
equilibrium. When a nation, says he, imports much, but does not export a corresponding
amount of goods, it may be forced to furnish payment in gold, and a
drainage of gold might give rise to a financial crisis. The indifference of the school
with regard to this question of the quantity of money is very much exaggerated
(Book II, chap. 13). The policy of the great central banks of to-day aims at
easing those tensions in the money market which appear as the result of over-importation,
and in this matter they have proved themselves much superior to
any system of Protection.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_612" id="Footnote_612"></a><a href="#FNanchor_612"><span class="label">[612]</span></a> Some writers go even farther. Patten (<i>Economic Foundations of Protection</i>)
longs to see a national type established peculiar to each country, as the
result of forcing the inhabitants to be nourished and clothed according to the
natural resources of the country in which they live. We should, as a consequence
of this, have an American type quite superior to any European type. “Then,”
says he, “we should be able to exercise a preponderant influence upon the fate of
other nations and could force them to renounce their present economic methods
and adopt a more highly developed social State.” Until then no foreign goods
are to enter the country. Here, as is very frequently the case, Protectionism is
confounded with nationalism or imperialism.</p>

agricultural-manufacturing State. The former is always more or less economically
and politically dependent on those foreign nations which take from it agricultural
products in exchange for manufactured goods. It cannot determine for itself
how much it will produce: it must wait and see how much others will buy from
it.” (<i>National System</i>, p. 145.)</p>

concerned not so much with the exportation of goods as with the migration
of capital. Ought the Minister for Foreign Affairs to veto the raising of a loan
in the home market on behalf of a foreign Power or an alien company? To what
extent ought bankers and capitalists to accept his advice? Such are some of the
questions that for some years past have been repeatedly asked in France, England,
and Germany. And it seems in almost every case that political economy has
had to bow before political necessity, and not <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

Geschichte der Nationalökonomie und des Sozialismus</i> (2nd ed., p. 362), insists on
the fact that Protection is not an essential element, but a mere temporary form
of the principle of national economic solidarity, which is List’s fundamental conception,
and which must survive all forms of Protection. Dühring is the only
real successor of List and Carey. He has developed their ideas with a great
deal of ability and has shown himself a really scientific thinker. But what
he chiefly admires in both writers is not their Protection, but their effort to lay
hold of the material and moral forces which lie below the mere fact of exchange,
and upon which a nation’s prosperity really depends. His <i>Kursus der National-
und Sozial-oekonomie</i> (Berlin, 1873) is very interesting reading.</p>

responsibility for a nation’s productive forces. List refers to them sympathetically,
especially to those who, like Michel Chevalier, “sought to discover the connection
of these doctrines with those of the premier schools, and to make their
ideas compatible with existing circumstances” (<i>National System</i>, p. 287). But
List differs from them in his love of individual liberty and in the importance
which he attaches to moral, political, and intellectual liberty as elements of
productive efficiency.</p>

thought, and truth or reality whether in nature or in human affairs is essentially
historical, at one time advancing, at another receding, evolving slowly, but always
undergoing some change.” In his <i>Contradictions économiques</i> he defines social
science as “the systematised study of society, not merely as it was in the past
or will be in the future, but as it is in the present in all its manifold appearances,
for only by looking at the whole of its activities can we hope to discover intelligence
and order.” (Vol. i, p. 43.) “If we apply this conception to the organisation
of labour we cannot agree with the economists when they say that it is
already completely organised, or with the socialists when they declare that it
must be organised, but simply that it is gradually organising itself; that is, that
the process of organisation has gone on since time immemorial and is still going
on, and that it will continue to go on. Science should always be on the look-out

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_623" id="Footnote_623"></a><a href="#FNanchor_623"><span class="label">[623]</span></a> It has been said that Proudhon borrowed this formula from Brissot de
Warville, the author of a work entitled <i>Recherches philosophiques sur le Droit
de Propriété et sur le Vol, considérés dans la Nature et dans la Société</i>. It was
first published in 1780, and reappeared with some modifications in vol. vi,
pp. 261 <i>et seq.</i>, of his <i>Bibliothèque philosophique du Législateur</i> (1782). But
this is a mistake. Proudhon declares that the work was unknown to him (<i>Justice</i>,
vol. i, p. 301); and, moreover, the formula is not there at all. Brissot’s point of
view is entirely different from Proudhon’s. The former believes that in a state
of nature the right of property is simply the outcome of want, and disappears
when that want is satisfied; that man, and even animals and plants, has a
right to everything that can satisfy his wants, but that the right disappears
with the satisfaction of the want. Consequently theft perpetrated under the
pressure of want simply means a return to nature. The rich are really the
thieves, because they refuse to the culprit the lawful satisfaction of his needs.
The result is a plea for a more lenient treatment of thieves. But Brissot is very
careful not to attack civil property, which is indispensable for the growth of
wealth and the expansion of commerce, although it has no foundation in a
natural right (p. 333). There is no mention of unearned income. Proudhon, on the
other hand, never even discusses the question as to whether property is based
upon want or not. He would certainly have referred to this if he had read Brissot.</p>

passages. “Property under the influence of division of labour has become a mere
link in the chain of circulation, and the proprietor himself a kind of toll-gatherer
who demands a toll from every commodity that passes his way. Property is the
real thief.” (<i>Banque d’Échange</i>, p. 166.) We must also remember that Proudhon
did not consider that taking interest was always illegal. In the controversy
with Bastiat he admits that it was necessary in the past, but that he has found
a way of getting rid of it altogether.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_626" id="Footnote_626"></a><a href="#FNanchor_626"><span class="label">[626]</span></a> We must distinguish between this and Marx’s doctrine. Marx believed that
all value is the product of labour. Proudhon refuses to admit this. He thinks
that value should in some way correspond to the quantity of labour, but that
this is not the case in present-day society. Marx was quite aware of the fact that
Proudhon did not share his views (see <i>Misère de la Philosophie</i>). Proudhon
follows Rodbertus, who taught that the products only and not their values are
provided by labour.</p>

without land and capital labour would be unproductive. But he soon forgets
his qualifications when he proceeds to draw conclusions, especially when he
comes to give an exposition of the Exchange Bank, where we meet with the
following sentence: “Society is built up as follows: All the raw material required
is gratuitously supplied by nature, so that in the economic world every product
is really begot of labour, and capital must be considered unproductive.” Elsewhere
he writes: “To work is not necessarily to produce anything.” (<i>Solution

<p><a name="Footnote_630" id="Footnote_630"></a><a href="#FNanchor_630"><span class="label">[630]</span></a> It is true that Proudhon’s attack is entirely directed against the ethics of
private property. He shows how every justification that is usually offered, such
as right of occupation, natural right, or labour, cannot justify the institution as
it is to-day. Private property as we know it is confined to the few, whereas
on these principles it ought to be widely diffused. Criticism of this kind is not
very difficult, perhaps, but it does nothing to weaken the arguments of those
who would justify property on the grounds of social utility. The criticism of the
Saint-Simonians, who approach it from the point of view of utility and productiveness
rather than from the ethical standpoint, seems to be much more profound.
This is why we have regarded them as the critics of private property.</p>

restraining economic forces whose strength has been so much exaggerated we
ought to try to balance them against one another in accordance with the little
known and less perfectly understood principle that contraries, far from being
mutually destructive, support one another just because of their contrary nature.”
(<i>Justice</i>, vol. i, pp. 265-266.) The same idea also finds expression on pp. 302-303.

wealth, which, without actually making men the slaves of one another, give entire
freedom to the producer, ease his toil, arouse his enthusiasm, and double his
produce by creating a real solidarity which is not based upon personal considerations,
but which binds men together with ties stronger than any which sympathetic
combination or voluntary contract can supply.” (<i>Idée générale de la
Révolution au XIXe Siècle</i>, p. 95.) The economic forces are somewhat differently
enumerated in chap. 13 of <i>La Capacité des Classes ouvrières</i>. Association and
mutuality are mentioned; but while recognising the prestige of the word “association,”
especially among working men, Proudhon concludes that the only real
association is mutuality—not in the sense of a mutual aid society, which he
thinks is altogether too narrow.</p>

He refers to it more than once, but especially in the <i>Idée générale de la Révolution</i>.
“Can association be regarded as an economic force? For my own part I
distinctly say, No. By itself it is sterile, even if it does not check production,
because of the limits it puts upon the liberty of the worker.” (P. 89.) “Association
means that everyone is responsible for someone else, and the least counts as
much as the greatest, the youngest as the oldest. It gets rid of inequality,
with the result that there is general awkwardness and incapacity.” (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

(<i>Propriété, 1er Mémoire</i>, p. 202.) That term will be possession pure and simple—the
right of property with no claim to unearned income. “Get rid of property,
but retain the right of possession, and this very simple change of principle will
result in an alteration of the laws, the method of government, and the character
of a nation’s economic institutions. Evil of every kind will be entirely swept
away.” Proudhon employed Hegelian terminology as early as 1840, four

at great length in his <i>Histoire de la Révolution de 1848</i> (chap. 11). The testimony
of contemporaries, especially Lamartine in his <i>Histoire de la Révolution
de 1848</i> (vol. ii, p. 120), is also very significant. “These national workshops were
placed under the direction of men who belonged to the anti-socialist party, whose
one aim was to spoil the experiment, but who managed to keep the sectaries of
the Luxembourg and the rebels of the clubs apart until the meeting of the
National Assembly. Paris was disgusted with the quantity and the character
of the work accomplished, but it little thought that these men had on more
than one occasion defended and protected the city. Far from being in the pay
of Louis Blanc, as some people seem to think, they were entirely at the beck and
call of his opponents.” É. Thomas in his <i>Histoire des Ateliers nationaux</i> (pp. 146-147)
relates how Marie sent for him on May 23 and secretly asked him whether
the men in the workshops could be relied upon. “Try to get them strongly
attached to you. Spare no expense. If there is any need we shall give you plenty

to <i>Le Représentant du Peuple</i> for April, afterwards published in book form
by Darimon, under the title of <i>Résumé de la Question sociale</i>. The plan differs
slightly from the statutes of the People’s Bank as they appear in vol. vi of the

given in <i>Le Peuple</i> in February and March 1849, just when the Bank was being
founded. There is still another account contained in the volume entitled <i>Intérêt
et Principal: Discussion entre M. Proudhon and M. Bastiat sur l’Intérêt du

who has some scheme which he wishes to carry out “will in the first place collect
orders, and on the strength of those orders get hold of some producer or dealer
who has such raw material or services at his disposal. Having obtained the goods,
he pays for them by means of promissory notes, which the bank, after taking due
precaution, will convert into circulation notes.” The consumer is really a sleeping
partner in the business, and between him and the <i>entrepreneur</i> there is no need
for the intervention of money at all. (<i>Organisation du Crédit, Œuvres</i>, vol. vi,
p. 123.) Discount was the fundamental characteristic of the bank, and no
criticism is directed against this feature of its operations.</p>

constitution and to dissolve or otherwise cause the disappearance of the political
or government system by reducing or simplifying, by decentralising and suppressing
the whole machinery of the State.” This idea was borrowed from Saint-Simon,
and Proudhon has acknowledged the debt in his <i>Idée générale</i>. This
conception of industrial society rendering government useless or reducing it to
harmless proportions is a development, though perhaps somewhat extravagant,
of the economic Liberalism of J. B. Say. The first edition of the <i>Mémoire sur

then? I am an anarchist.—I understand your doubts on this question. You

<p><a name="Footnote_681" id="Footnote_681"></a><a href="#FNanchor_681"><span class="label">[681]</span></a> Mazel gave an exposition of his scheme in a series of pamphlets written in
very bombastic language, but only of very slight interest to the economist.
Another bank known as Bonnard’s Bank was established at Marseilles in 1838,
and afterwards at Paris. The ideas are somewhat similar, but much more
practical. Both branches are still in active operation. Proudhon refers to this
bank in his <i>Capacité politique des Classes ouvrières</i>. Courcelle-Seneuil gives a
very eulogistic account of it in his <i>Traité des Banques</i>, and in an article in the
<i>Journal des Économistes</i> for April 1853. The <i>modus operandi</i> is explained in
three brochures, which may be seen in the Bibliothèque Nationale. One of these
is entitled <i>Liste des Articles disponibles à la Banque</i>; the other two describe the
mechanism of the bank. Darimon, one of Proudhon’s disciples, in his work <i>De la
Réforme des Banques</i> (Paris, Guillaumin, 1856), gives an account of a large number
of similar institutions which were founded during this period. Several systems
of the kind have also been discussed by M. Aucuy in his <i>Systèmes socialistes</i>
<i>d’Échange</i> (Paris, 1907). But we cannot accept his interpretation of various
points.</p>

<p>Bonnard’s Bank differs from the others in this way. The client of the bank,
instead of bringing it some commodity or other which may or may not be sold
by the bank, gets from the bank some commodity which he himself requires,
promising to supply the bank with a commodity of his own production whenever
the bank requires it. The bank charges a commission on every transaction.
Its one aim is to bring buyer and seller together, and the notes are simply bills,
payable according to the conditions written on them. But they cannot be
regarded as substitutes for bank bills. Cf. <i>Banque d’Échange de Marseille, C.
Bonnard et Cie., fondée par Acte du 10 Janvier</i>, 1849 (Marseilles, 1849).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_682" id="Footnote_682"></a><a href="#FNanchor_682"><span class="label">[682]</span></a> “I repudiate Mazel’s system root and branch,” he declares in an article contributed
to <i>Le Peuple</i> of December 1848 (<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. xvii, p. 221). He also
adds that when he wrote first he had no acquaintance of any kind with Mazel.
“It was M. Mazel who on his own initiative revealed his scheme to me and gave
me the idea.” In one of his projects, published on May 10, 1848, Proudhon seems
inclined to adopt this idea, just for a moment at any rate. Article 17 seems to
hint at this. “The notes will always be exchangeable at the bank and at the
offices of members, but only against goods and services, and in the same way
commodities and services can always be exchanged for notes.” (<i>Résumé de la
Question sociale</i>, p. 41.) This article justifies the interpretation which Courcelle-Seneuil
puts on it, in his <i>Traité des Operations de Banque</i> (9th ed., 1899, p. 470),
and which Ott accepts in his <i>Traité d’Économie sociale</i> (1851), which, moreover,
contains a profound analysis and some subtle criticism of Proudhon’s idea. But we
think that this article was simply an oversight on Proudhon’s part; for beyond
a formal refutation of Mazel’s idea there is no reference to it in any of his other
works, not even in the scheme of the People’s Bank. Moreover, it seems to
contradict the statement that the notes would be issued against commodities
which had been actually sold and delivered, as well as other articles of the scheme—<i>e.g.</i>
Article 30, dealing with buying and selling. It also conflicts with the idea
that the discounting of goods is the prime and essential operation of the bank.
In our opinion, Diehl in his book on Proudhon (<i>P. J. Proudhon, Seine Lehre
u. seine Leben</i>, vol. ii, p. 183) is wrong in thinking that the Exchange Bank would
issue notes against all kinds of goods without taking the trouble to discover
whether they had been sold or not.</p>

features that received the highest commendation from the Luxembourg Commission.
In <i>L’Exposé général de la Commission de Gouvernement pour les Travailleurs</i>,
which appeared in <i>Le Moniteur</i> of May 6, 1848, we read: “When in the future
association has become complete, there will be no need for notes even. Every
transaction will be carried on by balancing the accounts. Book-keepers will take
the place of collecting clerks. Money, both paper and metallic, is largely superfluous
even in present-day society.” The author then proceeds to outline a

p. 199), <i>à propos</i> the expression “at the moment of striking,” which Marx had
employed, Proudhon takes the opportunity of declaring that he is opposed to
all kinds of revolution. “You are perhaps still of opinion that no reform
is possible without some kind of struggle or revolution, as it used to be called,
but which is nothing more or less than a shock to society. That opinion I shared
for a long time. I was always willing to discuss it, to explain it, and to defend it.
But in my later studies I have completely changed my opinion. I think that
it is not in the least necessary, and that consequently we ought not to consider
revolution as a means of social reform. Revolution means an appeal to force,
which is clearly in contradiction to every project of reform. I prefer to put the
question in a different fashion, namely, How can we arrange the economic
activities of society in such a fashion that the wealth which is at present lost to
society may be retained for its use?” And in the <i>Confessions d’un Révolutionnaire</i>,
p. 61: “A revolution is an explosion of organic forces, an evolution
spreading from the heart of society through all its members. It can only
be justified if it be spontaneous, peaceful, and gradual. It would be as
tyrannous to try to suppress it as to bring it about through violence.” See
M. Bourguin’s article on Proudhon and Karl Marx in the <i>Revue d’Économie
politique</i>, 1893.</p>

appeared <i>The Past, the Present, and the Future</i>, which contains his theory of

<i>Harmonies</i> in 1850 Carey wrote a letter to the <i>Journal des Économistes</i> accusing
Bastiat of plagiarism. Bastiat, who was already on the point of death, wrote
to the same paper to defend himself. He admitted that he had read Carey’s
first book, and excuses himself for not making any reference to it on the ground
that Carey had said so many uncomplimentary things about the French that he
hesitated to recommend his work. Several foreign economists have since made
the assertion that Bastiat merely copied Carey, but this is a gross exaggeration.
Coincidence is a common feature in literary and scientific history. We have
quite a recent instance in the simultaneous appearance of the utility theory
in England and France.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_700" id="Footnote_700"></a><a href="#FNanchor_700"><span class="label">[700]</span></a> Frédéric Bastiat, born in 1801 near Bayonne, belonged to a family of fairly
wealthy merchants, and he himself became in turn a merchant, a farmer in the
Landes district, a justice of the peace, a councillor, and finally a deputy in the
Constituent Assembly of 1848. He made little impression in the Assembly;
but he scarcely had time to become known there before his health gave way. He
died at Rome in 1850, at the age of forty-nine.</p>

<p>Brief as was Bastiat’s life, his literary career was shorter still. It lasted just
six years. His first article appeared in the <i>Journal des Économistes</i> in 1844. His
one book, appropriately called <i>Les Harmonies économiques</i>, written in 1849,
remains a fragment. In the meantime he published his <i>Petits Pamphlets</i> and
his <i>Sophismes</i>, which were aimed at Protection and socialism. He was very
anxious to organise a French Free Trade League on the lines of that which won
such triumphs in England under the guidance of Cobden, but he did not succeed.</p>

<p>His life was that of the publicist rather than the scholar. He was not a
bookworm, although he had read Say before he was nineteen, and Franklin’s
<i>Poor Richard’s Almanac</i> soon afterwards. He was very enthusiastic about the
merits of Franklin’s works, and Franklin’s influence upon his writings, even upon
his personal appearance and behaviour, is very marked. “With his long hair,
his small cap, his long frock-coat, and his large umbrella, he seemed for all the
world like a rustic on a visit to town.” (Molinari in the <i>Journal des Économistes</i>,
February 1851.)</p>

<p>These biographical details should not be lost sight of, especially by those
who accuse him of lacking scientific culture and of being more of a journalist
than an economist.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that he has been severely judged by foreign economists, he is
still very popular in France. His wit is a little coarse, his irony somewhat blunt,
and his discourses are perhaps too superficial, but his moderation, his good
sense, and his lucidity leave an indelible impression on the mind. And we
are by no means certain that the <i>Harmonies</i> and the <i>Pamphlets</i> are not still the
best books that a young student of political economy can possibly read. Moreover,
we shall find by and by that the purely scientific part of his work is by
no means negligible.</p>

<p>“Socialists and economists, champions of equality and fraternity, I challenge
you, however numerous you may be, to raise even a shadow of objection to the
legitimacy of mutual service voluntarily rendered, and consequently against
the institution of private property as I have defined it. With regard to both
these considerations, men can only possess values, and values merely represent
equal services freely secured and freely given.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, chap. 8, pp. 265, 268.)</p>

<p>Had the limits of this work permitted us to speak of the Italian economists
we should have had to refer to Ferrara, professor at Turin from 1849 to 1858,
whose theory of value and economic harmony link him to his contemporaries
Carey and Bastiat. The whole economic edifice, according to Ferrara, was
built upon cost of production. The value of a commodity is not measured
by the amount of labour which it really has cost to produce, but by the amount
of labour that would be required to produce another similar commodity, or,
if the commodity in question be absolutely limited in quantity, such as is the
case with an old work of art, by the labour necessary to produce a new one
that would satisfy the same need equally well—an application of the principle
of substitution which had not been formulated when Ferrara wrote. The
progress of industry gradually reduces the cost of labour and dispenses with
human effort; hence harmony.</p>

<p>Everything, including the earth and its products, even capital, are subject
to this same law, and a gradual diminution of rent and a lowering of the rate
of interest are thus assured.</p>

<p>Ferrara’s principal writings consist of prefaces to Italian translations of the
works of the chief economists. They were published in a collection known as
<i>Biblioteca dell’ Economista</i> (Turin, 1850-70, 26 vols.).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_710" id="Footnote_710"></a><a href="#FNanchor_710"><span class="label">[710]</span></a> <i>Harmonies</i>, chap. 7, p. 236. The controversy between Bastiat and Proudhon
in 1849 concerning the legitimacy of interest was published under the title of
<i>Gratuité du Crédit</i>, but the argument is scarcely worth examining here. Bastiat’s
argument is based upon the supposition that the person who lends money
performs some service or other, and that the service, whenever given, should be
paid for; in other words, he maintains that capital is productive. A plane
means more planks produced, and it is only just that the owner of the plane
should get some of them. Proudhon replies that he does not deny the legitimacy
of interest under present conditions, but that interest itself is just a historical
category—to use a phrase that only became current after Proudhon’s time—and
that it will be quite unnecessary under the new <i>régime</i>. The Exchange Bank was
to be the parent of the new order. The two combatants never really come to
blows. They keep on arguing about nothing. The result is that this discussion
is very trying and brings little honour to either.</p>

This will depend upon its utility, and the number of people who are willing to

trouble to ask whether all these services are real and proper or whether men are
not sometimes paid for services which they never give. The world is full of
such injustices.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, chap. 5, p. 157.)</p>

<p>But if the world is full of people who are paid for services which they have
never given or for merely imaginary and improper work, what is the use of
speaking of value and property as if they were founded upon service rendered?</p>

that. It is as free as the water of the brook, if we only take the trouble to get
it, or pay others for getting it for us.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, chap. 10.) Bastiat would not
regard the shareholders’ dividends as payments for the trouble which the shareholders
have taken in getting the coal. The dividends simply pay for the trouble
taken to save the money which made the exploitation possible.</p>

<p>Say spoke of free natural agents. What he meant to refer to was such

on this subject was never completed. Fontenay, one of his disciples,
wrote a brilliant book called <i>Du Revenu foncier</i> (1854), which is almost forgotten
to-day. He attempted to show:</p>

<p>(1) That Ricardian or differential rent would not exist were all the land
equally fertile and suitably cultivated.</p>

<p>(2) That it is incorrect to speak of the rent of natural fertility, as Adam Smith
and the Physiocrats did, if all utility (and not merely value) is the product of
human labour. A fish, a grape, a grain of wheat, a fat ox, all of them have
been created by human industry. Nature is for ever incapable of doing this.
This is quite true if we say nature alone, but it is equally true of labour taken
by itself.</p>

formerly cost £60 and yielded 3 per cent. will now cost £100. There is no
decrease of the revenue and there is an increase in the capital. It is quite

this way he considered that the professor, the doctor and the actor had claims to

his way of putting it. He recognises no distinction between material and
immaterial wealth. There is nothing but utility. “It is true that taste, education,
etc., are immaterial, but so is everything that man produces.” But he is
entirely wrong when he says that a good teacher is a producer of enlightened
men and a doctor a producer of healthy persons. We are at a loss to explain

at Oxford. The Oxford chair, created in 1825, was the first chair of economics
to be established in England. His writings, which treat of various subjects,
belong to the period 1827-52. The bulk of his doctrine is contained in his
<i>Political Economy</i>, contributed to the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> in 1836 and afterwards
published separately. This small volume may be regarded as the earliest

honour to Senior, for the two facts belong to entirely different categories. Rent
is a purely economic phenomenon, resulting from the necessary conditions of
exchange. It owes nothing to social organisation, not even to the institution
of private property. Inheritance, on the other hand, is a purely juridical phenomenon,
the product of civil law. Even if inheritance were abolished it would
make no difference to the existence and growth of rent, whether obtained from
the soil or from some other source; whereas under the hypothetical <i>régime</i> of
perfectly free competition, although rent would no longer be known, inheritance,
together with all its privileges, might still continue to exist. Senior evidently
understands by the term “rent” any kind of income that is not obtained by
personal effort. But this is clearly a perversion of the original meaning.</p>

whom we have already spoken. The system of education which his father planned
for him can only be described as extraordinary. Practised on anyone else it would
have been fatal. At the age of ten he was already well versed in universal history
and in the literatures of Greece and Rome. At thirteen he had a fair grasp of
science and philosophy, and had written a history of Rome. By the time he was
fourteen he knew all the political economy that there was to know then. In
1829, then a young man of twenty-three, he published his first essays on political
economy. In 1843 appeared his well-known <i>System of Logic</i>, which immediately
established his fame. In 1848 he issued the admirable <i>Principles of Political
Economy</i>. Mill was in the service of the East India Company up to the time
when it lost its charter in 1858. From 1865 to 1868 he was a member of the
House of Commons. After the death of his wife, who collaborated with him
in the production of several of his works, especially <i>Liberty</i> (1859), being unwilling
to quit the spot where she lay buried, he spent the last years of his life,
except those taken up by his Parliamentary work, at Avignon. His autobiography
contains a precious account of his life and of his gradual conversion
to socialistic views.</p>

had already given an excellent definition of natural law. “By natural law
we are to understand those essential conditions that regulate all things in accordance
with the design laid down by the Author of Nature. They are the ‘essential
conditions’ to which men must submit if they would obtain all the benefits
which the natural order offers them.” (Introduction to Quesnay’s works, p. 21.)</p>

Sentiments</i> (see Book I, chap. 2), and Stuart Mill writes as follows: “In the
golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth we read the complete spirit of the ethics of
utility. To do as you would be done by and to love your neighbour as yourself
constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.” (<i>Utilitarianism</i>, chap. 2.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_757" id="Footnote_757"></a><a href="#FNanchor_757"><span class="label">[757]</span></a> This is how Mill views it: “It is only in a very imperfect state of the
world’s arrangements that anyone can best serve the happiness of others by
the absolute sacrifice of his own.” (<i>Utilitarianism</i>, chap. 2.) But it is scarcely
necessary to add, seeing that the two propositions are necessarily complementary,
that one of the best ways of securing happiness is to sacrifice one’s self in the
cause of others. All that is required is a little patience. “Education and
opinion will so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual
an indissoluble association between his happiness and the good of the whole.”
Interpreted in this way, individualism is closely akin even to the most transcendent
form of solidarity.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_758" id="Footnote_758"></a><a href="#FNanchor_758"><span class="label">[758]</span></a> One is sometimes asked to state the differences between the Classical, the
Individualist, the Liberal, and the Optimist schools. The question does not
seem to us to be a very important one, but we may answer it in this way:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Individualist school, according to the worst interpretation put
upon it, thinks that egoism is the only possible system of ethics and that
each for himself is the sole principle of action. But, naturally enough, everyone
is anxious to avoid the taunt of selfishness, and the existence of such economic
ties as exchange and division of labour make egoism impossible as an ethical
system. According to the broadest interpretation of the term, individualism
implies the recognition of individual welfare as the sole aim of every activity,
whether individual or social, economic or political. But this does not take us
very far, for every socialist and individualist would accept this interpretation.
We seldom speak of the welfare of society <i>per se</i> as an entity possessed of conscious
feeling. This definition is much too wide. It includes solidarity and association,
State intervention and labour legislation, provided the aim be to protect the
individual against certain dangers. Self-sacrifice is not excluded, for what can
strengthen individualism like self-sacrifice? This is the interpretation which
Schatz puts upon it in his <i>L’Individualisme économique et social</i>. But the term
“individualist” is too indefinite and we must avoid it whenever we can.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The so-called Liberal school uses the term in a much more definite fashion.
The individual is to be not merely the sole end of economic action, but he is
also to be the sole agent of the economic movement, because no one else can
understand his true interests or realise them in a better way. Interpreted in
this fashion, it means letting the individual alone and removing every external
intervention, whether by the State or the master.</p>

<p>According to the one definition, individualism is a creed which everyone
can adopt; according to the other it is open to very serious objections. Experience
shows that the individual, whether as consumer buying injurious, costly, or
useless commodities, or as worker working for wages that ruin his health and
lower his children’s vitality, is a poor judge of his own interest, and is helpless
to defend himself, even where science and hygiene are on his side.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If we push this interpretation a stage farther and admit not only that each
individual is best qualified to speak for himself, but also that the social interest
is simply the sum of the individual interests, all of which converge in a harmonious
whole, then the Liberal school becomes the Optimistic. In France it has the
tradition of a generation behind it, and an attempt has been made to revive it in
certain recent works; still it may now be regarded as somewhat antiquated.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) When we speak of the Classical school we mean those who have remained
faithful to the principles enunciated by the earlier masters of economic science.
An effort has been made to improve, to develop, and even to correct the older
theories, but no attempt has been made to change their essential aspects. Individualistic
and liberal by tradition, this school has never been optimistic. It
lays no claim to finality of doctrine or to the universality of its aim, but simply
confines itself to pure science.</p>

can be expected in morality, until the producing large families is regarded
with the same feelings as drunkenness or any other physical excess. But while
the aristocracy and clergy are foremost to set the example of this kind of incontinence
what can be expected of the poor?” (<i>Ibid.</i>, Ashley’s ed., p. 375, note.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_770" id="Footnote_770"></a><a href="#FNanchor_770"><span class="label">[770]</span></a> Stuart Mill admitted that trade unions might modify the relations between
demand and supply, forgetting for the moment that this meant a contradiction
of the Classical theory.</p>

<p>The unions might limit the number of available men. He feared that this
would result in high wages for the small number of organised labourers and in low
wages for the others. They might check the birth-rate, their members becoming
accustomed to such a degree of comfort and well-being as would raise their
standard of life. He was always a strict Malthusian.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_772" id="Footnote_772"></a><a href="#FNanchor_772"><span class="label">[772]</span></a> “The cost value of a thing means the cost value of the most costly portion
of it.” (<i>Principles</i>, Book III, chap. 6, § 1, prop. 7.)</p>

<p>“The extra gains which any producer or dealer obtains through superior
talents for business or superior business arrangements are very much of a similar
kind. If all his competitors had the same advantages, and used them, the benefit
would be transferred to their customers through the diminished value of the
article: he only retains it for himself because he is able to bring his commodity to
market at a lower cost while its value is determined by a higher.” (<i>Ibid.</i>,
Book III, chap. 5, § 4.)</p>

<p>Senior had already emphasised one important difference between agricultural
and industrial production, namely that whilst the law of diminishing returns
operates in the former case, the law of increasing returns is operative in the
second. In other words, the cost of production diminishes as the quantity
produced increases. The result is, as Mill points out elsewhere, that the
industrial employer is anxious to reduce the sale price in order to produce
more and to recoup himself for a reduction in price by a reduced cost of
production.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_773" id="Footnote_773"></a><a href="#FNanchor_773"><span class="label">[773]</span></a> Ricardo, moreover, gives an exposition of the advantages of international
trade in terms that Bastiat might have adopted. “Under a system of perfectly
free commerce each country naturally devotes its capital and labour to such
employments as are most beneficial to each. This pursuit of individual advantage
is admirably connected with the universal good of the whole. By stimulating
industry, by rewarding ingenuity, and by using most efficaciously the peculiar
powers bestowed by nature, it distributes labour most effectively and most
economically: while by increasing the general mass of productions it diffuses
general benefit and binds together, by one common tie of interest and intercourse,
the universal society of nations throughout the civilised world. It is this principle
which determines that wine shall be made in France and Portugal, that corn shall
be grown in America and Poland, and that hardware and other goods shall be
manufactured in England.” (Ricardo, <i>Works</i>, p. 75.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_774" id="Footnote_774"></a><a href="#FNanchor_774"><span class="label">[774]</span></a> The following apparent paradox may be deduced from Ricardo’s theory.
A country is wise in importing not only those commodities which it can only
produce at a disadvantage as compared with its rivals, but also those goods in
which it has a distinct advantage in the matter of production, though not so
great as the advantage enjoyed in some other case. Under those circumstances
it is better that it should produce that product in the making of which it has the
greater advantage and exchange it for some other product in which it has less.</p>

<p>“Two men can both make shoes and hats, and one is superior to the other
in both employments; but in making hats, he can only exceed his competitor
by one-fifth, or 20 per cent., and in making shoes he can excel him by one-third,
or 33 per cent. Will it not be for the interest of both, that the superior man
should employ himself exclusively in making shoes, and the inferior man in making
hats.” (Ricardo, <i>Works</i>, p. 77, note.)</p>

<p>And so England might find it advantageous to exchange her coal for French
cloths, although she may be able to produce those cloths cheaper herself.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_775" id="Footnote_775"></a><a href="#FNanchor_775"><span class="label">[775]</span></a> “The value of a thing in any place depends on the cost of its acquisition
in that place; which in the case of an imported article means the cost of production
of the thing which is exported to pay for it.” (<i>Principles</i>, Book III,
chap. 18, § 1.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_776" id="Footnote_776"></a><a href="#FNanchor_776"><span class="label">[776]</span></a> Mill first treated of the theory in his <i>Unsettled Questions of Political Economy</i>.
A more complicated but more precise exposition is given in the <i>Principles</i>
Book III, chap. 18, § 7. The whole process of reasoning, based as it is upon
the hypothetical conduct of two persons, is purely abstract, and is of very little
practical use. What is really important is to know the relation between the
advantages gained by either side. It is true that on the whole imports and exports
balance one another, thanks to the operation of money, but that is another
question.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_777" id="Footnote_777"></a><a href="#FNanchor_777"><span class="label">[777]</span></a> “It still appears, that the countries which carry on their foreign trade on the
most advantageous terms are those whose commodities are most in demand by
foreign countries, and which have themselves the least demand for foreign
commodities, from which, among other consequences, it follows that the richest
countries, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, gain the least by a given amount of foreign commerce,
since, having a greater demand for commodities generally they are likely to
have a greater demand for foreign commodities and thus modify the terms of
interchange to their own disadvantage.” (<i>Principles</i>, Book III, chap. 18, § 8.)
Note the phrase “a given amount of foreign commerce.” That is, although the
rate of interchange is less advantageous for the rich country than it is for the
poor, still, since the former exchanges much more than the latter it gains more
on the whole transaction. Mill states this expressly elsewhere. The rich and
the poor country are like the wholesale house and the little shop. The former
gains very little on each article sold, but gains much on the whole turnover.</p>

retarded, not stopped, shall continue its course there can be little doubt that the
status of hired labourers will gradually tend to confine itself to the description
of workpeople whose low moral qualities render them unfit for anything more
independent, and that the relation of masters and workpeople will be gradually
superseded by partnership in one of two forms: in some cases, association of the
labourers with the capitalist; in others, and perhaps finally in all, association of
labourers among themselves.” (<i>Principles</i>, Book IV, chap. 7, § 4.)</p>

<p>“In this or some such mode, the existing accumulations of capital might
honestly and by a kind of spontaneous process become in the end the joint
property of all who participate in their productive employment—a transformation
which, thus effected, would be the nearest approach to social justice and the
most beneficial ordering of industrial affairs for the universal good which it is
possible at present to foresee.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, Book IV, chap. 7, § 6.)</p>

convert to peasant proprietorship. But peasant proprietorship is proposed
simply as a step towards association.</p>

<p>“The opinion expressed in a former part of this treatise respecting small
landed properties and peasant proprietors may have made the reader anticipate
that a wide diffusion of property in land is the resource on which I rely
for exempting at least the agricultural labourers from exclusive dependence on
labour for hire. Such, however, is not my opinion. I indeed deem that form
of agricultural economy to be most groundlessly cried down, and to be greatly
preferable in its aggregate effects on human happiness to hired labour in any form
in which it exists at present. But the aim of improvement should be not solely
to place human beings in a condition in which they will be able to do without
one another, but to enable them to work with or for one another in relations
not involving dependence.” (<i>Principles</i>, Book IV, chap. 7, § 4.)</p>

<p>Mill was not the only one who looked to peasant proprietorship partly to solve
the social problem. Not to mention Sismondi, who was very much taken up
with the idea, we have Thornton in England in his <i>Plea for Peasant Proprietors</i>
(1848) and Hippolyte Passy in France in his excellent little volume <i>Des Systèmes
de Culture</i> (1852) strongly advocating it. The Classical economists for the
most part took the opposite point of view, especially Lavergne in his <i>Essai sur
l’Économie rurale de l’Angleterre</i>.</p>

without regard to existing opinions and sentiments, I should prefer to restrict,
not what anyone might bequeath, but what anyone should be permitted to
acquire by bequest or inheritance. Each person should have power to dispose
by will of his or her whole property; but not to lavish it in enriching some one
individual beyond a certain maximum.” (<i>Principles</i>, Book II, chap. 2, § 4.)</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that this limitation of the right of inheritance
is a purely personal opinion of Mill, and that it is rejected along with his other
solutions by most individualists. It is not quite correct to say then, as Schatz
has said in his <i>Individualism</i>, that Stuart Mill is “the very incarnation of the
individualistic spirit.” He was really a somewhat sceptical disciple of the school,
and his frequent change of opinion was very embarrassing!</p>

the lowest that will induce the people of that country and time to accumulate
savings.… But though the minimum rate of profit is thus liable to vary, and
though to specify exactly what it is would at any given time be impossible, such
a minimum always exists; and whether it be high or low, when once it is reached
no further increase of capital can for the present take place. The country has
then attained what is known to political economists under the name of the
Stationary State.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, Book IV, chap. 4, § 3.)</p>

<p>Mill indicates the causes that contribute to a fall in the rate of profits as
well as the causes that arrest that fall, such as the progress of production and
the destruction of wealth by wars and crises.</p>

<p>It may be worth while pointing out that the word profit as employed by the
English economists, and especially by Mill, has not the same meaning as it has
with the French writers. French economists since the time of Say have employed
the term profit to denote the earnings of the <i>entrepreneur</i>, the capitalist’s income
being designated interest. The English economists do not distinguish between
the work of the <i>entrepreneur</i> and that of the capitalist, and the term profit covers
them both. The result is that the French Hedonistic economists can say that
under a <i>régime</i> of absolutely free competition profit would fall to zero, while the
English economists cannot accept their thesis because profits include interest,
which will always remain as the reward of waiting.</p>

he was infected with the atomic views of Adam Smith and never showed himself
sufficiently conscious of the ethical nature of society. “List seems to think that
the entire subordination of private interest to public utility is dictated by custom,
and even by private interest when properly understood, but he never regards
it as a public duty rising out of the very nature of society itself.” (Hildebrand,

of economic life, and how this economic life has contributed to the perfection of
mankind. Its task is to follow the economic evolution of nations as well as of
humanity as a whole, and to discover the bases of the present economic civilisation

<i>English Economic History and Theory</i> writes as follows: “Just as the history of
society, in spite of apparent retrogressions, reveals an orderly development,
so there has been an orderly development in the history of what men have
thought, and therefore in what they have thought concerning the economic
side of life.” And Ingram, in his <i>History of Political Economy</i>, points out
that “As we have more than once indicated, an essential part of the idea of
life is that of development—in other words, of ordered change. And that
such a development takes place in the constitution and working of society in
all its elements is a fact which cannot be doubted.… That there exist
between the several social elements such relations as make the change of one
element involve or determine the change of another is equally plain; and why
the name of natural laws should be denied to such constant relations of coexistence
and succession it is not easy to see. These laws being universal admit
of the construction of an abstract theory of economic development.” (P. 205.)</p>

truths.”</p>

the Old Political Economy</i>. “It was the labour question, unsolved by that
removal of restrictions which was all deductive political economy had to offer,
that revived the method of observation. Political economy was transformed
by the working classes.” Elsewhere he adds: “The Historical method is often
deemed conservative, because it traces the gradual and stately growth of our
venerable institutions; but it may exercise a precisely opposite influence by
showing the gross injustice which was blindly perpetrated during this growth.”

we have not dealt in this book—namely, the criticism of <i>laissez-faire</i>. Some of
the members, <i>e.g.</i> Hildebrand, have insisted on the ethical criterion, but none
of them share in the optimism of either Smith or Bastiat. The emphasis laid
upon relativity made this quite impossible. But all the more eminent writers
have remained faithful to the Liberal teaching of the founders. See Hildebrand’s
confession of faith at the beginning of vol. i of the <i>Jahrbücher für
Nationalökonomie</i>, 1863, vol. i, p. 3. And although some of them, <i>e.g.</i> Brentano
and Schmoller, seem to be connected with the new current of ideas that gave
rise to State Socialism, the association was quite accidental. They never considered
it an organic part of their teaching, and they made no very original
contribution to that part of the study. Their connection with economics must
always depend upon the light which they have thrown upon the question of
method.</p>

the same opinion in his <i>History</i>. “Political economy is not a body of absolutely
true doctrines, revealed to the world at the end of the last and the beginning of
the present century, but a number of more or less valuable theories and generalisations.…
Modern economic theories, therefore, are not universally true; they
are true neither for the past, when the conditions they postulate did not exist,
nor for the future, when, unless society becomes stationary, the conditions will
have changed.” (Preface.)</p>

the existence of air or friction, any more than the student of pure mathematics
denies the existence of real bodies, of surfaces, and lines, or the student of pure
chemistry denies the influence of physical forces or the physicist the presence
of chemical factors in actual phenomena, although each of these sciences only
considers one side of the real world, making an abstraction of every other aspect
of it. Nor does the economist pretend that men are only moved by egoism or
that they are infallible and omniscient because they envisage social life from
the point of view of the free play of individual interest uninfluenced by other considerations,
by sin or ignorance.” Wagner and Marshall take the same view.</p>

sense. In other words, although it cannot discover the general laws
regulating phenomena, it may show what special circumstances (whose general
laws are already supposed to be known) have given rise to some event equally
specialised in character. But every honest historian has to admit that such
explanations are definitely personal and subjective in character. For a recent
examination of these ideas from the pen of a historian see the profound yet
charming introduction contributed by Meyer to the second edition of his <i>Geschichte

<p><a name="Footnote_856" id="Footnote_856"></a><a href="#FNanchor_856"><span class="label">[856]</span></a> This is what M. Renouvier thinks of this conception: “If we proceed
to ask another question in addition to the difficult one already asked and inquire
as to the circumstances under which different nations have advanced or declined
in the path of goodness and of truth and transmitted their triumphs or their
defeats to the next generations, and if we support ourselves in the quest by
the belief that we already have some knowledge of a scientific law and consequently
of the aim of human society (this kind of knowledge generally begins with
formulating such aims), we shall find ourselves in the position of a religious
prophet who, not merely content with an inspired version of the truth, and of the
destiny of mankind, proceeds to expound to his auditors the necessity under
which both preacher and auditors are compelled to believe and to act in accordance
with what will undoubtedly come to pass. Philosophical and religious
imagination seeks in external observation the elements of a confidence which it
can no longer place in itself. History becomes a kind of inspiring divinity. But
although the object of the illusion is different its nature is still the same, for the
new deity is as little effective as were the ancient ones in the opinion of those
who have no faith in it, and it only inspires those who already believe.” (<i>Introduction
à la Philosophie analytique de l’Histoire</i>, 2nd ed., vol. i, p. 121.) Bergson’s
philosophy also contests the possibility of guessing what the future may be like
from the character of the present. See especially <i>Creative Evolution</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_861" id="Footnote_861"></a><a href="#FNanchor_861"><span class="label">[861]</span></a> It is interesting to learn the views of historians on this point. Meyer
thinks that the object of history is not to discover the general laws of development,
but to describe and explain particular concrete events as they succeed
one another. Such descriptions can only be made in accordance with the rules
of historical criticism, but explanation is only possible with the aid of analogy.
“It is only by the use of analogy that the historian can explain past events,
especially where there are psychological motives that require analysis. The
explanation thus given will necessarily be of a subjective character, and from
its very nature somewhat problematic.” Cf. Ed. Meyer, <i>Geschichte des Alterthums</i>,
Introduction, 2nd ed. §§ 112 <i>et seq.</i> There does not seem to be any connection
between this method and that of Aug. Comte. One becomes still more
convinced of this after reading Langlois and Seignobos’s <i>Introduction aux Études
historiques</i> or G. Monod’s study in historical method in <i>De la Méthode dans
les Sciences</i> (Paris, 1909), or, finally, the numerous articles dealing with this
question of method which have appeared in the <i>Revue de Synthèse historique</i>.</p>

statistics. This science, though independent of political economy, is, however,
such a powerful auxiliary that its progress has to some extent been parallel
with the growth of economics. During the last twenty years the methods of
interpreting statistics (we are speaking merely of observation) have been very
considerably improved. The logical problems involved have been studied with
much care, and the application of mathematics to these problems has proved
very fruitful. No student of the social sciences can afford to neglect such
mathematical theories as those of combination, correlation, degree of error, etc.
The history of statistics, which contains many eminent names, from Quetelet
to Karl Pearson, would certainly deserve a chapter in a book dealing with method,
although there would be some risk of giving it too statistical a bias. We must
rest content with referring the reader to Udny Yule’s <i>Introduction to the Theory of
Statistics</i>, which constitutes what is perhaps the best recent introduction to the
discussion concerning the method to be employed in this social science, and forms
an indispensable complement to the study of the problems examined in this
chapter.</p>

respecting the limits of that doctrine; as, for example, what amount of public
control is admissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitary

since the evidence was sifted by Menger in his <i>Das Recht auf den vollen Arbeitsertrag</i>
(1st ed., 1886). But Menger only mentions two sources of inspiration, Proudhon
and the Saint-Simonians. The text will sufficiently indicate his indebtedness
to the Saint-Simonians, but we think that Sismondi might well have been substituted
for Proudhon. The only Proudhonian doctrine that is discoverable in
Rodbertus is the theory concerning the constitution of value. But in the second of
the <i>Soziale Briefe</i> (<i>Schriften</i>, vol. ii, p. 46, note) he states definitely that the idea
was not a borrowed one, and that he himself was the first to formulate it, although
he omits to state in what connection. He may be referring to a passage in his
<i>Forderungen</i>, where the idea is quite clearly expressed. Speaking of Ricardo’s
theory of value, he says: “That theory comes to grief on a single issue, namely,
in regarding a thing as existing when it only exists in the mind, and treating a
thing as a reality when it only becomes real in the future.” (<i>Schriften</i>, vol. iii,
p. 120.) It is clearly pointed out that the task of the future is to determine
what value is. The <i>Forderungen</i>, where all the master ideas of Rodbertus may
be studied, was published in 1837, nine years before the <i>Contradictions économiques</i>
was published by Proudhon, who made his first reference to the question in that
work.</p>

death. It was translated into French in 1904 by M. Chatelain, and published by
Messrs. Giard and Brière. Our references in the succeeding pages are to this

<p><a name="Footnote_901" id="Footnote_901"></a><a href="#FNanchor_901"><span class="label">[901]</span></a> The question of the net and gross product was one of the outstanding
problems of this period. Vidal (<i>Répartition des Richesses</i>, p. 219, Paris, 1846) and
Ott (<i>Traité d’Économie sociale</i>, p. 95, 1851) lay stress upon it. Since then Cournot,
Dühring, and more recently Effertz and Landry, have handled the problem anew.
But each of them when he comes to define the word “productivity” defines it in
his own fashion, so that they do not really discuss the same question. Rodbertus,
as we shall have occasion to point out in the text, uses the word in a very vague
fashion indeed, but still it is the basis of his whole discussion. It seems to us
that under a <i>régime</i> of division of labour rentability should be the one criterion.
But it would be a mistake to imagine that when dwindling profits make a change
in the methods of production imperative, that change will be welcomed with
equal enthusiasm by everybody, by both master and worker alike.</p>

guide. Many collective wants must be satisfied, but the process is not always a
profitable one. The problem is to determine which are those wants. Rodbertus
is speaking of private wants; he has taken good care to leave the public needs
aside, so that his argument applies only to the former.</p>

only labour.” In the third of the <i>Soziale Briefe</i> he expresses this idea in a
slightly different form: “All economic goods are the product of labour”
(<i>Schriften</i>, vol. ii, pp. 105-106). Developing the same thought, he declares that
this formula means: (1) that “only those goods which have involved labour
should figure in the category of economic goods”; (2) that, “economically
speaking, goods are regarded, not as the product of nature or of any other force,
but simply as the product of labour”; (3) that “goods economically considered
are just the product of labour, carried out by means of the material operations
which are necessary for production.” The work of industrial direction and its
remuneration are regarded in the same light. Cf. <i>Schriften</i>, vol. ii, p. 219.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_908" id="Footnote_908"></a><a href="#FNanchor_908"><span class="label">[908]</span></a> Rodbertus expressly declares that to say that goods are the product of
labour is not to imply that the value of the product is always equal to what it cost
in the way of labour, or, in other words, that the labour spent on it does not
always measure its value (<i>Schriften</i>, vol. ii, pp. 104, 105). A similar statement
is made in the <i>Forderungen</i> (1837). In the <i>Zur Erkenntniss</i> (1842)
(pp. 129-131) he gives some of the reasons why he thinks that the value of a
product is not equal to the labour it has cost: (1) There is the necessity
for equalising the gains of capital; (2) the price of a unit of any commodity
is fixed by the price of the unit which costs most to reproduce.
In the second of the <i>Soziale Briefe</i> he repeats the statement that the labour
value theory is nothing better than an ideal (<i>Kapital</i>, Appendix, p. 279). In a
letter written to R. Meyer on January 7, 1872, he affirms the demonstration
which he had already given, “that goods do not and cannot exchange merely in
proportion to the quantity of labour which has been absorbed by them simply
because of the existence of capital”; and he adds the significant words: “a
demonstration that might in case of need be employed against Marx.”</p>

of any such hypothesis, and it really plays quite an auxiliary or subordinate <i>rôle</i>.
It is in the course of his exposition of the theory concerning the distribution of
unearned income between landed proprietors and capitalists (quite an erroneous
theory, by the way) that he is driven to admit that “the exchange value of each
completed product, as well as of each portion of the product, is equal to its labour
value.” (Third <i>Sozial Brief, Schriften</i>, vol. ii, p. 101.)</p>

higher classes is a somewhat novel one, but it is quite definitely stated by Rodbertus.
“The classes can only influence the market in proportion to the quantity
of the social product which is given them. But the <i>entrepreneurs</i> must determine
the quantities which they will produce, according to the size of their
demands.” (<i>Kapital</i>, pp. 51-52. Cf. also pp. 170-171.) It is quite obvious, on
the contrary, that the <i>entrepreneurs</i> base their production solely upon the
demand for the particular goods which they manufacture, and that they are quite
indifferent to the share which goes to the higher classes.</p>

theories if we read the passage in the article on <i>Balance des Consommations
avec les Productions</i>, published by Sismondi as an appendix to the second
edition of the <i>Nouveaux Principes</i>, vol. ii, p. 430. Rodbertus agrees with
Sismondi that equilibrium will be re-established in the long run, but that in the
meantime a crisis may have to intervene. (<i>Kapital</i>, p. 171, note; cf. <a href="#Page_190">p. 190</a>, <i>supra</i>.)</p>

and such is the verdict of M. Chatelain after studying the United States census
returns. According to Chatelain (<i>Questions pratiques de Législation ouvrière</i>,
June and July, 1908), the American metal-workers’ share in the product fell
from 71 to 68 per cent. between the years 1890 and 1905, while capital’s share
increased from 28 to 32 per cent. The men’s wages during the same period
rose from 551 dollars to 626, while the rate of interest fell from 9 to 8 per
cent. Despite this diminution in labour’s share of the total product it is impossible
to say whether the remuneration of labour in general is moving upward
or downward, for the working classes do not depend solely upon the wages of
their labour. Some of them have a little capital—a very small amount, perhaps,
but there is no reason for thinking that it will not grow in future.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that this complicated question must be carefully defined.
Three different factors must be distinguished: (1) The individual’s wage;
(2) labour’s share in the product; (3) the income of the working class. On this
problem see Edwin Cannan’s article in the <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>,
1905, and his statements in his <i>Theory of Production and Distribution</i>, 1776-1848.</p>

R. Meyer, he declares that the great problem “is to help us to pass by a peaceful
evolution from our present system, which is based upon private property in land
and capital, to that superior social order which must succeed it in the natural
course of history, which will be based upon desert and the mere ownership of

has himself defined this somewhat Machiavellian attitude in a letter written to
Marx in 1859, in which he speaks of a drama which he had just written dealing
with Franz von Sickingen. “It looks like the triumph of superior realistic ability
when the leader of a rebellion takes account of the limited means at his disposal
and attempts to hide from other men the real object which he has in view. But
the success achieved by deceiving the ruling classes in this way puts him in
possession of new forces which enable him to employ this partial triumph for carrying
out his real object.” (<i>Aus dem litterarischen Nachlass von K. Marx, F. Engels,

“He is too liable to be influenced by the immediate circumstances of the moment.
He exaggerates the trivial difference between himself and a nonentity like
Schulze-Delitzsch, until the issue between them, governmental intervention as
against private initiative, becomes the central point of his agitation.”</p>

in Lévy-Brühl’s <i>L’Allemagne depuis Liebnitz</i>, especially p. 398 (Paris, 1890).
The State, according to Hegel, is an expression of the spirit realising itself in the
conscience of the world, while nature is an expression of the same spirit without
the conscience, an <i>alter ego</i>—a spirit in bondage. God moving in the world has
made the State possible. Its foundation is in the might of reason realising itself
in will. It is necessary to think of it not merely as a given State or a particular
institution, but of its essence or idea as a real manifestation of the mind of God.
Every State, of whatever kind it may be, partakes of this divine essence. For
full information concerning the philosophical origin of State Socialism see
Andler’s <i>Le Socialisme d’État en Allemagne</i> (1897).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_935" id="Footnote_935"></a><a href="#FNanchor_935"><span class="label">[935]</span></a> Fichte issued a very curious work in 1800 entitled <i>Der geschlossene Handelsstaat</i>,
published in vol. iii of his complete works (Berlin, 1845), and containing
ideas with many points of resemblance to those of State Socialism. Fichte
thought that the State should not merely guarantee to every citizen his property,
but should first of all rear its citizens, let them build their property, and then
defend it. In order to do this everyone should be given the necessary means of
livelihood, for the one aim of all human activity is to live, and everyone here
has an equal right to live (p. 402)—a declaration of the right of existence. Until
all are so provided for no luxuries should be allowed. No one should decorate his
house until he feels certain that everyone has a house, and everyone should be
comfortably and warmly clad before anyone is elegantly dressed (p. 400). “Nor
is it enough to say that I can afford to pay for it, for it is unjust that one individual
should be able to buy luxuries while his fellow citizens have not enough
to procure the necessaries of life. The money with which the former purchases
his luxuries would in a rational State not be his at all.” Adopting this as his
guiding principle, Fichte proposes to organise a State in which the members
of every profession, agriculturists, artisans, merchants, etc., would make a
collective contract with one another, in which they would promise not to encroach
upon one another’s labour, but would guarantee to everyone a sufficient
number of the goods which each has made for his own use. The State would also
undertake to see that the number of persons in every profession was neither too
few nor too many. It would also fix the price of goods. Lastly, in view of the
fact that foreign trade would naturally upset the equilibrium established by the
contract which guaranteed security of existence to each individual, the commercial
State would have to be entirely hemmed in by tariff walls. The whole
work is original and interesting. A. Menger, who gives a brief <i>résumé</i> of it in
his second chapter of <i>The Right to the Whole Produce of Labour</i>, thinks that
Fichte was influenced by what he saw of the Convention during the Reign of
Terror, by the issue of assignats, and perhaps by Babeuf. Fichte, on the other
hand, takes care to point out that his commercial State is not realisable as such,
but that a book like his is not less useful in view of the general hints which it
affords a statesman.</p>

opinion that such a delimitation is impossible, and that when we are speaking
of the State and the individual we are speaking of two distinct powers, such as
life and law (p. vii). Law has to follow in the footsteps of life, reproving its
excesses and correcting its faults (p. xiii).</p>

series of Insurance Acts admits the necessity for a more marked policy of State
intervention: “To lay hold of the ways and means whereby the working classes
may best be helped is by no means an easy task, but it is one of the highest which
a moral and Christian community can set its heart upon.” Bismarck, in his
speech of May 9, 1884, said: “I unhesitatingly recognise the rights of labour, and
so long as I occupy this place I shall uphold them. In so doing I base my plea,
not upon socialism, but upon the Prussian Landrecht.” Section 2 of Art. XIX of the
second part of the Prussian Landrecht (February 5, 1794) reads as follows: “To
such as have neither the means nor the opportunity of earning their own livelihood
or that of their family, work shall be given, adapted to their strength and
capacity.” Despite its general tone, it did not contemplate giving relief.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_963" id="Footnote_963"></a><a href="#FNanchor_963"><span class="label">[963]</span></a> The well-known German economist Professor Lexis has unfortunately not
been mentioned in this chapter, for the Göttingen professor has the misfortune
of being neither a State Socialist nor a member of the Historical school. His
works, dealing with various topics—money, the population theory, and general
economic theory—are scattered through a number of reviews and other publications,
especially the <i>Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik</i>, Schönberg’s
<i>Handbuch</i>, and the great <i>Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften</i>. His writings
are distinguished not only by a definitely scientific method of treatment, but
also by a remarkable clearness of thought. While appearing to continue the
tradition of the Classical school, he takes care to reject the optimistic conclusions
which are too often regarded as an inseparable element of that tradition. In
1900 Lexis gave us a general <i>résumé</i> of his teaching in the <i>Allgemeine Volkswirtschaftslehre</i>,
where he treats of the economic world as concerned merely
with the circulation of goods. In addition to an interesting theory of crises,
upon which we cannot dwell just now, the most original part of the work consists
of a theory concerning the method of distributing the social product between
workers and capitalists. Lexis thinks that all material goods are produced by
labour and measurable in terms of labour. The problem then is to determine
where the capitalist gets his income. The capitalist’s profit is not the result of
exploitation, as Marx thought, but is simply what is added to the sale price—a
sum corresponding to the capitalist’s interest is added to the sum representing
the workmen’s wages. Profit originates in the sphere of circulation. But how
will this increased sale price benefit the capitalists, seeing that under existing
conditions the workers can only buy the equivalent of the products which they
have already helped to produce? We need to remember, however, that they
produce for the capitalist as well as for themselves, and with the money thus
obtained the working classes are enabled to buy whatever they need at market
prices, <i>i.e.</i> at a price that includes interest, which constitutes the capitalist’s
profit. Whenever the capitalists themselves purchase goods made by themselves
they are reciprocally benefiting one another. Their class position is not
modified by such procedure, for each <i>entrepreneur</i> simply draws profits in proportion
to his capital. And so we avoid the most serious objection which can be
raised to Marx’s theory. This explanation of the surplus value received by
the capitalists is at least very ingenious. Lexis has been mostly influenced
by Marx and Rodbertus, and has attempted a fusion of their more vigorous
conceptions. Despite the objections that might be raised to it, the work is
certainly one of the most original of recent years.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_964" id="Footnote_964"></a><a href="#FNanchor_964"><span class="label">[964]</span></a> Karl Marx, generally spoken of as a Jew, was born on May 5, 1818, of
Jewish parents who had been converted to Protestantism. Born of a respectable
<i>bourgeois</i> family and wedded to the daughter of a German baron, few
would have predicted for him the career of a militant socialist. Such was to be
his lot, however. In 1843, at the age of twenty-five, the authorities having
suppressed a newspaper which he was conducting, he fled to Paris, and thence
to Brussels. Returning to Germany during the Revolution of 1848, in which
he took an active part, he was again expelled, and this time took refuge in London
(1849). Here he spent the rest of his life (about thirty years), leaving for France
a short time before his death in 1883. He died at London on March 14 in that year.</p>

<p>Although Marx was one of the founders and directors of the famous association
known as the “International,” which was the terror of every European
Government between 1863 and 1872, he was not a mere revolutionary like his
rival Bakunin, nor was he a famous tribune of the people like Lassalle. He
was essentially a student, an affectionate father, like Proudhon, an indefatigable
traveller, and a man of great intellectual culture.</p>

<p>The best known of his works, which is frequently quoted but seldom read,
is <i>Das Kapital</i>, of which the first volume—the only one published during his lifetime—appeared
in 1867. The other two volumes were issued after his death,
in 1885 and 1894, through the efforts of his collaborator Engels.</p>

<p>This book has exercised a great influence upon nineteenth-century thought,
and probably no work, with the exception of the Bible and the Pandects, has given
rise to such a host of commentators and apologists. Marx’s other writings, though
much less frequently quoted, are also exceedingly important, especially <i>La
Misère de la Philosophie</i>, published in 1847 in answer to Proudhon’s <i>Les Contradictions
Économiques</i>; <i>Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</i> (1859); and particularly
the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, published in January 1848. The <i>Manifesto</i>
is merely a pamphlet, and at first it attracted scarcely any attention, but Labriola
goes so far as to say—not without some exaggeration, perhaps—that “the date of
its publication marks the beginning of a new era” (<i>Essai sur la Conception
matérialiste de l’Histoire</i>, p. 81). At any rate, it is the breviary of modern
socialism. There is scarcely a single one of its phrases, each of which stings like
a dart, that has not been invoked a thousand times. The <i>Programme of the
Communist Manifesto</i> is included in Ensor’s <i>Modern Socialism</i>.</p>

<p>It is a much-debated question as to whether Karl Marx was influenced by
French socialists, and if so to what extent. On the question of his indebtedness
to Pecqueur and Proudhon see Bourguin’s article in <i>La Revue d’Économie politique</i>,
1892, on <i>Des Rapports entre Proudhon et K. Marx</i>. Proudhon’s work,
at any rate, was known to him, for one of his books was a refutation of the
doctrines of the <i>petit bourgeois</i>, as he called him. Certain analogies between
the works of these two writers to which we shall have to call attention will
help us to appreciate the extent to which Marx is indebted to Proudhon. But,
as Anton Menger has pointed out, we must seek Marx’s antecedents among
English socialists, in the works of writers like Thompson especially. Nor
must we forget his friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels, who for the sake
of his master has been content to remain in the background. Engels collaborated
in the publication of the famous <i>Manifesto</i> in 1848, and it was
he who piously collected and edited Karl Marx’s posthumous work. It is
difficult to know exactly what part he played in the development of Marx’s ideas,
but it is highly probable that it was considerable.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_965" id="Footnote_965"></a><a href="#FNanchor_965"><span class="label">[965]</span></a> Marx calls attention to the fact that even Aristotle was puzzled by this
common element which exchanged objects seemed to possess, and by the fact
that exchange appeared to make them of equal value. We say that 5 beds =
1 house. “What is that equal something, that common substance, which admits
of the value of the beds being expressed by a house? Such a thing, in truth,
cannot exist, says Aristotle. And why not? Compared with the beds the
house does represent something equal to them, in so far as it represents what is
really equal, both in the beds and the house. And that is—human labour.”
(<i>Kapital</i>, p. 29; Moore and Aveling’s translation—to which the Translator is
indebted for the succeeding quotations also.)</p>

<p>“If we make abstraction from its use-value we make abstraction at the same
time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a use-value.…
Its existence as a material thing is put out of sight. Neither can it any
longer be regarded as the product of the labour of the joiner, the mason, the
spinner, or of any other definite kind of productive labour … there is nothing
left but what is common to them all; all are reduced to one and the same sort
of labour—human labour in the abstract.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 5.)</p>

takes in the eyes of the labourer himself the form of a commodity which is
his property; his labour consequently becomes wage-labour.… Given the
individual, the production of labour-power consists in his reproduction of himself
or his maintenance. For his maintenance he requires a given quantity of the
means of subsistence. Therefore the labour-time requisite for the production
of labour-power reduces itself to that necessary for the production of those
means of subsistence: in other words, the value of labour-power is the value
of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer.”

<p><a name="Footnote_967" id="Footnote_967"></a><a href="#FNanchor_967"><span class="label">[967]</span></a> This demonstration implies that the wages drawn by the worker is necessarily
only just equal to the value of the means of his subsistence. It is the
old classic law of Turgot and Ricardo over again, which Lassalle, Marx’s contemporary
and rival, graphically called the “brazen law of wages.” We are simply
given a more scientific demonstration of it, that is all.</p>

<p>The demonstration is based upon a postulate which ought first to have been
proved, namely, that the quantity of labour necessary to keep the worker alive
is always less than the quantity which he provides for his master. But what
is there to prove that a man who works ten hours a day does not require all
those ten hours to produce sufficient for his upkeep? Is there some natural
law that supports this contention? Marx simply regards it as an axiom and
attempts no proof. Everyone would admit it to be true in a general way—as
a kind of empirical law. For were it true that man’s labour was wholly
absorbed by the necessaries of life there would be no increase of numbers, no
saving of capital, and civilisation, which is the product of leisure, would never
have been possible.</p>

<p>What we have here is the Physiocratic “net product” once again, with this
difference, that instead of being confined to agricultural labour it is now regarded
as an attribute of labour of every kind.</p>

to hand labour, leaving 100 per cent. surplus value, is put forward merely for
the sake of illustration. Some Marxians, however, among whom is Jules Guesde,
claim that this is actually the proportion in practice. Marx himself would
probably have been more moderate in his estimate, because in one part of his
thesis he accepts the statement of English manufacturers who declared that it
was just the last hour that gave them their profits.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_970" id="Footnote_970"></a><a href="#FNanchor_970"><span class="label">[970]</span></a> The development of machinery, according to the Marxian theory, tends
to reduce the cost of living, and consequently the price of labour, by producing
cheaper clothes, furniture, etc., and to a lesser extent cheaper food.</p>

<p>By parity of reasoning ought it not to reduce the price of goods produced
by the wage-earner and so lower the surplus value? We must be careful,
however, not to confuse a reduction in the price of each unit with a reduction
in the total value of the articles produced by machinery. A yard of cloth produced
by a modern loom has not the same value as a yard produced by an old
hand-loom. But the value of the total quantity produced each day must be
equal to the value produced by hand, provided the same number of hours have
been spent upon its production.</p>

done and of adding to the surplus value, such as the speeding up of labour.
Speeding up does not increase the value of the goods, because the value depends
upon the time spent upon them, and not upon the intensity of the effort put
forth, but it does lower the cost of production.</p>

Cf. <a href="#Page_215">p. 215</a>, where something is said about the different phases through which
the idea of exploitation has passed.</p>

<p>Although Marx never says that the worker is actually robbed by the capitalist,
but simply that the capitalist profits by circumstances which he is powerless
to change, that has not prevented him treating the capitalist somewhat
harshly and unjustly even, judging from his own point of view. He speaks
of the capitalist as “a vampire which thrives upon the blood of others and
becomes stouter and broader the more blood it gets.” He might have added
that no blame could be attached to the vampire, seeing that it only obeyed
the tendencies of its nature.</p>

per cent., as in the example chosen just now, the total surplus value in A will
be £900, equal to a profit of 90 per cent. on a capital of £1000. B, on the other

after his death.</p>

<p>It is true that Marx had drawn attention to the contradiction in the first
volume, but no explanation was forthcoming until the later volumes appeared.
Having stated that the greater quantity of surplus value is the direct result of
the greater proportion of circulating capital employed, he proceeds: “This
law clearly contradicts all experience based on appearance. Everyone knows
that a cotton-spinner who, reckoning the percentage on the whole of his applied
capital, employs much constant and little variable capital, does not, on account
of this, pocket less profit or surplus value than a baker who relatively sets in
motion much variable and little constant capital. For the solution of this
apparent contradiction many intermediate terms are as yet wanted, as from the
standpoint of elementary algebra many intermediate terms are wanted to demonstrate
that 0/0 may represent an actual magnitude.… Vulgar economy, which,
indeed, has really learnt nothing, here, as everywhere, sticks to appearance
in opposition to the law which regulates and explains them.” (<i>Kapital</i>, p. 274.)</p>

<p>It is probable that Marx was not very well satisfied with his explanation,
which may account for his reluctance to publish it during his lifetime.</p>

value be at the rate of 100 per cent. of the circulating capital, the total capital

<p><a name="Footnote_979" id="Footnote_979"></a><a href="#FNanchor_979"><span class="label">[979]</span></a> We have indifferently employed the terms “profit” and “surplus value”
simply because the former is a much more familiar word. But we must warn
the reader against thinking that the two terms are synonymous. The surplus
value is all that part of the value of the produce which is over and above the
expenses of labour involved in its production—that enormous slice which becomes
the property of every class in society except the workers, not merely the employers,
but merchants, landlords, etc.; while profit is that part of the surplus value
which the employers of labour keep for their own use. The rate of profit also
is something quite different from the percentage of surplus value, as we shall
see later.</p>

<p>We must call attention once more to the different interpretations which have
been given of the term “profit.” Marx and the English economists take the
word to comprise the whole revenue of capital under a <i>régime</i> of free competition,
no distinction being drawn between profit properly so called and interest. To-day
we understand by profit the income drawn by the <i>entrepreneur</i>—as distinct
from the capitalist—as the result of certain favourable circumstances, notably
imperfect competition.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to speak of a law of equality of profit, seeing that profit,

of starting with a preconceived idea, much after the style of economists like
Bastiat, for example. Such a method, it is contended, is utterly unscientific
and unworthy of a great mind like Marx’s.</p>

<p>However great he may have been, we cannot help thinking that, in common
with most scientists, he discovered just what he was looking for, and it would
be difficult to prove that Marx was not a socialist long before he began the
writing of <i>Kapital</i>, even long before he had constructed a system at all.</p>

<p>Our object in stating the conclusion first of all is to help the reader to an
understanding of the argument, but it is quite open to anyone who thinks
differently to say that Marx had not the least idea where the analysis would
lead him.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_981" id="Footnote_981"></a><a href="#FNanchor_981"><span class="label">[981]</span></a> The general use of the term “collectivism” is largely due to Marx. While
“collectivism” occurs almost on every page of the <i>Manifesto</i>, the term “communism,”
on the other hand, is never once employed.</p>

<p>James Guillaume, in the preface to the second volume of Bakunin’s works,
p. xxxvi, gives the following account of the origin of the word “collectivism”:
“At the fourth General Congress of the International, held at Bâle in 1869, almost
every delegate voted in favour of collective property. But there were two
distinct opinions cherished by the delegates present. The German-Swiss, the
English, and the German delegates were really State communists. The Spanish,
Belgian, French-Swiss, and most of the French delegates were federal or anarchist
communists who took the name of collectivists. Bakunin belonged to the
second group, and to this group also belonged the Belgian Paepe and the French
Varlin.” Bakunin always spoke of himself as a collectivist and not a communist,
and in this respect he differs from Marx. The habit of thinking that
all anarchists are communists is largely due to Kropotkin.</p>

“to announce the inevitable and imminent downfall of <i>bourgeois</i> property.”</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, it is more usual to characterise the aim of collectivism
as an attempt to abolish the wage-earning class—abolition of property being
simply a step towards that. This is how Labriola writes in his <i>Essai sur la
Conception matérialiste</i> (2nd ed., p. 62): “The proletariat must learn to concentrate
upon one thing, namely, the abolition of the wage-earner.”</p>

<p>It is well to remember that such is also the aim of the Associationists, the
co-operators, and the Radical Socialists. They proceed, however, from the opposite
point of view, and would multiply property rather than abolish it, thinking
that the latter process would merely universalise the wage-earner.</p>

the way to describe him, for it is necessary that we should remember that the
vast majority of those who consider themselves socialists are more or less his
disciples. The other socialist schools, the anarchists, the Fabians, the Collinsists,
and the followers of Henry George, cut a very poor figure beside his.</p>

<p>The bulk of his adherents is drawn either from Germany or Russia, England
being the country which has done least to swell the ranks of his followers. In
France the pure doctrine has been vigorously preached since 1878 by MM. Jules
Guesde and Lafargue—the latter of whom is Marx’s son-in-law. But a great
many French socialists, though collectivists in name, refuse their adhesion to
the Marxian doctrine in all its rigidity. They have accepted three of his main
principles—the socialisation of the means of production, class war, and internationalism—but
reject his theory of value and his materialistic conception of
history. Moreover, they show no desire to break with the French socialist
tradition, which was pre-eminently idealistic. Benoît Malon, the founder of the
<i>Revue socialiste</i> (1885), was one of the earliest representatives of French collectivism,
and among his successors may be reckoned M. George Renard and
Fournière.</p>

a theory of value—in the accepted sense of the term in Marx. What we have
is a theory of economic equilibrium which would only be true of a very rudimentary
kind of society. It is assumed, for example, that all industries are
equally easy or difficult, that all the workers are of one type, that ten men
working for one hour will produce the same amount of wealth no matter what
task they are engaged upon. It is this equality that enables comparison to be
made between one commodity and another, and this constitutes their value.
We are simply treated to an abstraction which shows that with the exercise
of a little ingenuity it is at least possible to reconcile the theory of time-value
and the theory of market price.</p>

whole social outlook. “The hand-mill gave us the servile State; the steam-mill
is the parent of the industrial, capitalist State.” (<i>Misère de la Philosophie</i>,
2nd ed., p. 156.) This oft-repeated phrase contains a picturesque antithesis
rather than a scientific formula of historical materialism. In his preface to his
<i>Kritik der politischen Oekonomie</i> Marx expresses himself with much more moderation.
The following is the most important passage of that celebrated page
(p. 5):</p>

<p>“In the course of their efforts at production men enter into certain definite
and necessary relations which may be wholly independent of their own individual
preferences—such industrial ties being, of course, correlative to the state of their
productive forces. Taken together, all these links constitute the economic structure
of society. In other words, it supplies a basis upon which the legal and
political superstructure is raised, and corresponding to it are certain social forms
which depend upon the public conscience. The method of producing commodities,
speaking generally, fixes the social, political, and intellectual <i>processus</i>
of life. A man’s conscience has less to do with determining his manner of life
than has his manner of life with determining the state of his conscience.”</p>

<p>The word “fixes,” even when qualified by “speaking generally,” seems
a little pronounced, and Marxism has substituted the term “explained,”
which is somewhat nearer the mark. Labriola says that “it merely represents
an attempt to explain historical facts in the light of the economic substructure.”
(<i>Conception matérialiste</i>, p. 120.)</p>

<p>This materialistic conception is developed in a very paradoxical fashion in
Loria’s <i>La Constitution sociale</i>. He shows how all history and every war,
whether of Guelph or of Ghibelline, the Reformation and the French Revolution,
and even the death of Christ upon Calvary, rest upon an economic basis. In
Loria’s opinion, however, this basal fact is not industrialism, but the various
types of land systems. See the chapter on Rent.</p>

<p>It would not be correct to regard Marxism as a mere expression of fatalism
or out-and-out determinism. The Marxian pretends to be, and as a matter of
fact he really is, a great believer in will-power. Once the workers see where their
interests really lie he would have them move towards that goal with irresistible
strength. It is not always even necessary to define the end quite clearly before
beginning to move. “Everything that has happened in history has, of course,
been the work of man, but only very rarely has it been the result of deliberate
choice and well-considered planning on his part.” (Labriola, <i>Conception
matérialiste</i>, p. 133.) Elsewhere: “The successive creation of different social
environments means the development of man himself.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 131-132.)</p>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of this work to enter into a metaphysical
discussion of these theories, however much one would like to.</p>

should get all that he produces.”</p>

<p>M. Landry, in a book of lectures delivered by different authors entitled

fact that the Saint-Simonians had already emphasised the antagonism by
speaking, not of rich and poor, but of idlers and workers. The differentiation,

the Saint-Simonians included within the category workers, bankers, and

p. 674) writes as follows: “While we Marxians are trying to repatch the
master’s cloak political economy is making some headway every day. If we
compare Marx’s <i>Kapital</i> with Marshall’s <i>Principles</i>—chapter by chapter, that is
to say—we shall find that problems which required a few hundred pages in the
<i>Kapital</i> are solved in a few lines by Marshall.” B. Croce (<i>Materialismo storico
ed Economia marxistica</i>, 1900, p. 105) writes thus: “I am strongly in favour
of economic construction along Hedonistic lines. But that does not satisfy the
natural desire for a sociological treatment of profits, and such treatment is
impossible unless we make use of the comparative considerations suggested
by Marx.” Lastly, Sorel, in <i>Saggi di Critica del Marxismo</i> (1903, p. 13)
says: “It is necessary to give up the attempt to transform socialism into a
science.”</p>

to the law of value not merely must one devote the socially necessary amount
of time to the production of each commodity, but each group of commodities
must have such extra effort spent upon it as the nature of the commodity or
the character of the demand requires. The first condition of value is utility or
the satisfaction of some social need—that is, value in use raised to such a degree
of potentiality as shall determine the proportion of total social labour to each
of the various kinds of production.” (<i>Kapital</i>, vol. iii.)</p>

<p>Bernstein adds: “This admission makes it impossible to treat the themes
of Gossen, of Jevons, and of Böhm-Bawerk as so many insignificant irrelevancies.”

what does Bernstein propose to substitute for the revolutionary ideal—impracticable
as it was—of the German Social Democratic party? The alternative
offered is a simple democratic, reformist evolution, a political or economic
development which would just be a pale imitation of the <i>bourgeois</i> Liberal <i>régime</i>,
which it is hoped would result in the emancipation of the workers by getting rid
of <i>bourgeois</i> Liberalism altogether. The complete democratisation of politics and
economics would, it is hoped, effect the necessary improvement. On this point
we syndicalists must definitely part company with Bernstein and his <i>confrères</i>,

peculiarly healthy. “I have shown,” says he, “that proletarian violence has
an entirely different significance from that usually attributed to it by politicians
and amateur students of society.” It is incorrect, however, to say that he is
in favour of sabotage. “Sabotage,” says Sorel, “belongs to the old <i>régime</i>,
but does nothing to set the worker in the way of emancipation.” (<i>Mouvement
socialiste</i>, 1905, November 1 and 15.)</p>

École Polytechnique. He subsequently became a professor at the École des Mines
and a Counseiller d’État. In 1855 he published a collection of monographs dealing
with working-class families under the title of <i>Les Ouvriers européens</i>, in one volume
(the second edition, which appeared in 1877, consisted of six volumes). In 1864
he published an exposition of his social creed in <i>La Réforme sociale</i>, a book that
Montalembert declared to be “the most original, the most courageous, the most
useful, and altogether the most powerful book of the century.” It hardly deserves
such extravagant praise, perhaps, but it is true that many of its more pessimistic
prophecies concerning the future of France have been very curiously verified.</p>

<p>In 1856 Le Play founded La Société d’Économie sociale, which since 1881 has
been responsible for the publication of <i>La Réforme sociale</i>. He organised the
Universal Exhibition in 1867, and was one of the first to arrange exhibitions of
social work. For a <i>résumé</i> of his life and work see <i>Frédéric Le Play d’après lui-même</i>,

Only in this way can the poor hope to offer some real security. “How is it that

certain by means of combination. Union eliminates the uncertainty which
hitherto made the security worthless and the loan impossible.” (<i>La Question du

<p><a name="Footnote_1057" id="Footnote_1057"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1057"><span class="label">[1057]</span></a> Moufang’s principal writings were published in 1864 under the title of <i>Le
Question ouvrière et le Christianisme</i>. He could never make up his mind as between
the corporative and the co-operative ideal, however. The latter was very
much to the front just then, not only in France, but also with the English
Christian Socialists and with the German socialist Lassalle. This was before the
co-operative movement was eclipsed by trade unionism.</p>

<p>Hitze, however, shows none of his master’s hesitation, but emphatically
declares that “the solution of the social question is essentially and exclusively
bound up with a reorganisation of trades and professions. We must have the
mediæval <i>régime</i> of corporations re-established—a <i>régime</i> which offers a better
solution of the social problem than any which existed either before or after. Of
course times have changed, and certain features of the mediæval <i>régime</i> would
need modification. But some such corporative <i>régime</i> conceived in a more
democratic spirit must form the economic basis.” (<i>Capital and Labour.</i>)</p>

upon this one reform—the corporative reorganisation of society.” (<i>Programme

<p>Co-operative association is dismissed altogether. The Social Catholics
have especially little sympathy with the small retail co-operative stores, because
they threaten the existence of the small merchant and the small artisan—types
of individuals that are dear to the heart of the Catholics. On the other
hand, it shows itself very favourably inclined towards co-operative credit, because
of the possibility of assisting the classes already referred to—the shopkeeper and
the small merchant.</p>

“without minimising the difficulties which stand in the way of extending the
mixed <i>syndicats</i>, the formation of such <i>syndicats</i> must be our chief aim.” In 1904
Father Rutten, one of the leaders of the Belgian Catholic Syndical movement, in
a report on the syndicalist movement writes as follows: “We do not despair
of the mixed <i>syndicat</i>, which in theory we certainly think is nearest perfection.
But we must not blind ourselves to facts, and whether we will or no we have to
admit that at the present moment the mixed <i>syndicat</i> in ninety industries out of
every hundred seems quite Utopian.” (Quoted by Dechesne, <i>Syndicats Ouvriers

<p><a name="Footnote_1060" id="Footnote_1060"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1060"><span class="label">[1060]</span></a> Such is the programme as outlined especially in Austria, which is one of the
countries where Social Catholicism seems fairly powerful. As a matter of fact,
the corporative <i>régime</i> has never quite disappeared there, and for some years now
attempts have been made to revive it in the smaller crafts. The new corporation
would take the form of a centralised organisation, whose regulations would be
obligatory upon all the members of the craft.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1061" id="Footnote_1061"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1061"><span class="label">[1061]</span></a> “The commune has always been organised. Is there any reason why the
trade should not be? In both cases special relations are established, special
needs arise, there are frequent conflicts and occasional harmony between the
different interests. But all of them are nevertheless intimately bound together,
and the links connecting them must be co-ordinated on some regular plan if every
one is to be safe, and free to follow his own bent.” (Henri Lorin, <i>Principes de
l’Organisation professionnelle</i>, in <i>L’Association catholique</i>, July 15, 1892.)</p>

<p>To this it might be replied that the majority generally makes the law for the
commune, but that in the case of a free corporation it is often the minority that
rules. To which it might be retorted that the so-called majority is often not
better than a minority of the electors, and a very small minority indeed of the
whole inhabitants—who of course include women, who generally have no votes.
Moreover, as soon as the rules of the <i>syndicat</i> became really obligatory the
majority if not the whole of the workers in the trade would be found within the
union.</p>

social question can never be completely solved until we have a complete revival of
Christian morals.” Still more categorical is the declaration of M. Léon Harmel
in <i>L’Association catholique</i> for December 1889: “We can see only one remedy,
and that is that the authority of the Pope should be recognised all the world
over, and his ruling accepted by all people.”</p>

<p>The annual study reunions which go by the name of <i>les Semaines sociales</i>,
and which afford one of the best manifestations of the kind of activities which
Social Christianity gives rise to everywhere, are not so exclusive. Economic
questions of all kinds are discussed, but the programme is not strictly Catholic
at all, and the basis is wide enough to include everyone who is a professed
Christian.</p>

iniquity of profit-making society, and which is from an economical point of view
the final cause of social suffering, is nothing better than a word invented to hide
the real fact, namely, the appropriation of the fruits of labour by those who
possess the instruments of labour.” (Loesewitz, <i>Législation du Travail</i>, in

<p>“<span class="smcap">Marc Sangnier.</span> The social transformation which we desire to see, comrades,
will aim, not at absorbing the individual, but rather at developing him.
We want the factories, the mines, and the industries in the possession, not of
the State, but of groups of workers.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">An Interrupter.</span> That is socialism.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Marc Sangnier.</span> You can call it socialism if you like. It makes no
difference to me. But it is not the socialism of the socialists, of the centralising
socialists. We don’t want to set the proletarians free from the control of the
masters to put them under the immediate control of one great master, the
State; we want the proletarians themselves, acting collectively, to become their
own masters.”</p>

Social school which is Liberal and individualist in its tendencies, and which is
represented by such writers as the late Charles Périn, professor at Louvain,
author of <i>La Richesse</i> and <i>La Socialisme chrétien</i>, and by M. Rambaud, author
of <i>Cours d’Histoire des Doctrines</i>. Nor ought we to forget their connection
with the development of agricultural credit banks of the Raiffeisen type which
have been established in Germany, France, and Italy—although their inception
in Italy is largely the work of a Jew named Wollemborg.</p>

kept in mind in dealing with this subject, such as, for example, the notable fact
that while the Catholic Church has always been opposed to usury, it was Calvin
and Calvinists like Saumaise and the ancient jurist Dumoulin who first justified
the practice of taking interest.</p>

the People</i>, founded in 1848, which may be taken as the birthday of the movement.
In any case the date is significant in view of the contemporary revolution
in France.</p>

<p>It is only just to note that Channing, the American pastor, who died in 1842,
was one of the pioneers. His writings on social questions are still read.</p>

caused such a sensation that the vicar of the parish felt bound to protest against
its tone even during the service. In the course of the sermon Kingsley remarked
that any social system which enabled capital to become the possession of a
few, which robbed the masses of the land which they and their ancestors had
cultivated from time immemorial, and reduced them to the condition of serfs
working for daily wage or for charity, was contrary to the spirit of the Kingdom
of God, as revealed in Christ. The sermon was afterwards published under
the title of <i>The Church’s Message to the Workers</i>.</p>

But the significance of the word “socialist” has changed somewhat since then.

government will take in future, and I have no doubt as to its success, but a preliminary
training extending possibly over a couple of generations is necessary
before the worker has the requisite ability or moral strength to make use of it.”
(Kingsley in 1856.)</p>

<p>And this is how State intervention appealed to him: “The devil is always
ready to urge us to change law and government, heaven and earth even, but
takes good care never to suggest that we might change ourselves.”</p>

be Christianised first of all.” On the question of unemployment, for example, he
refers us to Matthew xx, 6, and on the still more vexed question of the closed or

he thinks altogether too conservative and reactionary. He adds that Karl
Marx is a crusted Tory compared with Jesus, “for any one who accepts private
property in any form whatsoever, even in matters of consumption, must reject

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1108" id="Footnote_1108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1108"><span class="label">[1108]</span></a> The name varies a little with different authors and in different countries.
“The final degree of utility” is the term used by Jevons, “marginal utility” by
the Americans, “the intensity of the last satisfied want” by Walras. Walras
also speaks of it as “scarcity,” using the term in a purely subjective fashion to
denote insufficiency for present need. This very plethora of terms suggests a
certain haziness of conception. The term “marginal” seems clearer than
the term “final,” although in some cases it may be impossible to oust the
latter.</p>

<p>It appears that the first suggestion of final utility in the sense in which it is
employed by the Psychological school is due to a French engineer of the name of
Dupuit. He threw out the suggestion in two memoirs entitled <i>La Mesure de
l’Utilité des Travaux publics</i> (1844) and <i>L’Utilité des Voies de Communication</i>
(1849), both of which were published in the <i>Annales des Ponts et Chaussées</i>,
although their real importance was not realised until a long time afterwards.
Gossen also, whose book is referred to on p. 529, was one of the earliest to
discover it.</p>

<p>In its present form it was first expounded by Stanley Jevons in his <i>Theory of
Political Economy</i>, and by Karl Menger in his <i>Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftlehre</i>
(1871). Walras’s conception of scarcity, which is just a parallel idea, was
made public about the same time (1874). Finally Clark, the American economist,
in his <i>Philosophy of Value</i>, which is of a somewhat later date (1881), seems to
have arrived at a similar conclusion by an entirely different method—a remarkable
example of simultaneous discoveries, which are by no means rare in the
history of thought.</p>

<p>Despite its cosmopolitan origin, the school is generally spoken of as the
Austrian school, because its most eminent representatives have for the most
part been Austrians. Among these we may mention Karl Menger, already
referred to, Professor Sax (<i>Das Wesen und die Aufgabe der Nationalökonomie</i>,
1884), Wieser (<i>Der natürliche Werth</i>, 1889), and of course Böhm-Bawerk
(author of <i>Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerths</i>, in <i>Jahrbücher
für Nationalökonomie</i>, 1886, and the well-known book on capital and
interest).</p>

<p>Lately, however, the doctrine seems to have changed its nationality and
become wholly American. The American professors J. B. Clark, Patten, Irving
Fisher, Carver, Fetter, etc., are assiduous students of marginal utility, applying
the conception not only to problems of capital and interest, but also to the
question of distribution.</p>

in two such very different senses—a confusion that is inevitable however one
may try to avoid it—Pareto has substituted the word “ophelimity,” and Gide
in his <i>Principles</i> (1883) “desirability.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1110" id="Footnote_1110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1110"><span class="label">[1110]</span></a> “The idea of final utility is the ‘open sesame,’ the key to the most complicated
phenomena of economic life, affording a solution of its most difficult
problems.” (Böhm-Bawerk, <i>The Austrian Economists</i>, in <i>Annals of the American
Academy of Political and Social Science</i>, 1891.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1111" id="Footnote_1111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1111"><span class="label">[1111]</span></a> Condillac had already drawn attention to this fact (see <a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>), and Buffon
had noted it even before that. “The poor man’s coin which goes to pay for the
necessaries of life and the last coin that goes to fill the financier’s purse are in
the opinion of the mathematician two units of the same order, but to the moralist
the one is worth a louis, the other not a cent.” (<i>Essai d’Arithmétique morale.</i>)</p>

<p>The connection between quantity and demand is best expressed by means of
a curve either of utility or of demand (see <a href="#Page_532">p. 532</a>). Along the horizontal line let
the figures 1, 2, 3, 4 denote the quantities consumed, and from each of these
points draw a vertical line to denote the intensity of demand for each of these
quantities. The height of the ordinate decreases more or less rapidly as the
quantity increases, until at last it falls to zero.</p>

a descending one to represent the utility of each handful of rice acquired, the two
curves must necessarily intersect, seeing that one is just the inverse of the other.
The point of intersection marks the place where the utilities of the two exchanged
handfuls are exactly equal.</p>

<p>We must be careful not to confuse matters, however. It is not suggested that
the final utilities in the case of the two co-exchangers are equal. There is no
common measure by which the desires of different persons can be compared, and
no bridge from one to the other. What is implied is that the final utility of both
commodities for the <i>same person</i> are the same. The balance lies between two
preferences of the same individual. The actual market exchange is just the
resultant of all these virtual exchanges.</p>

<p>The Austrian school in its explanation makes use of a hypothesis known as
the double limit, which does not seem to be absolutely indispensable, seeing that
other economists of the same school—Walras, for example—appear to get on well
enough without it. They seem to think of buyers and sellers drawn up in two
rows facing one another. Every one of the sellers attributes to the object
which he possesses and which he wants to sell a certain utility different from his
neighbour’s. Each buyer in the same way attributes to that object which he
desires to buy a degree of utility which is different from that which his neighbour
puts upon it. The first exchange, which will probably have the effect of fixing
the price for all the other buyers and sellers, will take place between the buyer
who attributes the greatest utility to the commodity he has to sell, and who is
therefore least compelled to sell, and the buyer who attributes the least utility to
the commodity he wishes to buy and who is therefore least tempted to buy. At
first sight it seems impossible that the party as a whole should be bound by the
action of the two individuals who show the least inclination to come to terms.
It would be more natural to expect the first move to take place between the seller
who is forced to sell and because of his urgency is content with a price of 10<i>s.</i>
per bushel, say, and the buyer who feels the strongest desire to buy and who
rather than go without would be willing to give 30<i>s.</i> for it. But upon consideration
it will be found that the price is indeterminate just because these two are
ready to treat at any price. The most impatient individual will surely wait to
see what terms the least pressed will be able to make, and it is only natural that
those who are nearest one another should be the first to come together. These
two co-exchangists who control the market are known as the “limiting couple.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1116" id="Footnote_1116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1116"><span class="label">[1116]</span></a> The new school deduces a very curious conclusion from this law of
indifference. Although there is only one price for all corn buyers, say, the
final utility of the corn for each individual is by no means the same. Let us
assume that the price is 20<i>s.</i>, but one of the buyers, rather than go without, would
possibly have given 25<i>s.</i> for it, and others might have been willing to give 24<i>s.</i>, 23<i>s.</i>,
22<i>s.</i>, etc. Every one of those who <i>ex hypothesi</i> only pay 20<i>s.</i> gains a surplus which
Professor Marshall has called consumer’s rent (<i>Principles</i>, Book III, chap. 6).
He has given it that name in order to facilitate comparison with producer’s
rent, which had gained notoriety long before the Hedonistic school arose. Both
are due to similar causes, namely, the existence of differential advantages
which give rise to a substantial margin between the selling price and the cost of
production.</p>

<p>Really, however, the similarity is simply a matter of words, because consumer’s
rent is purely subjective, whereas producer’s rent is a marketable commodity.
It would be better to say simply that in many cases of exchange it is not correct
to argue that because the prices are equal the satisfaction given to different
persons is necessarily equal.</p>

writers we wish to suggest that they have a common programme. All we mean
is that they make use of the same method.</p>

<p>It is generally recognised to-day that the school dates from the appearance
of Cournot’s <i>Recherches sur les Principes mathématiques de la Théorie des Richesses</i>
(1838). Cournot, who was a school inspector, died in 1877, leaving behind
him several philosophical works which are now considered to be of some
importance. The story of his economic work affords an illustration of the
kind of misfortune which awaits a person who is in advance of his age. For
several years not a single copy of the book was sold. In 1863 the author tried
to overcome the indifference of the public by recasting the work and omitting
the algebraical formulæ. This time the book was called <i>Principes de la Théorie
des Richesses</i>. In 1876 he published it again in a still more elementary form,
and under the title of <i>Revue sommaire des Doctrines économiques</i>, but with
the same result. It was only shortly before his death that attention was
drawn to the merits of the work in a glowing tribute which was paid to him by
Stanley Jevons.</p>

<p>Gossen’s book, <i>Entwickelung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs</i>, which
appeared much later (1853), was equally unfortunate. The author remained an
obscure civil servant all his life. His book, of which there is still a copy in
the British Museum—the only one in existence possibly—was accidentally
discovered by Professor Adamson, and Stanley Jevons was again the first to
recognise its merits. A brief <i>résumé</i> of the work will be found in our chapter
on Rent.</p>

<p>Stanley Jevons (died 1882) belongs both to the Mathematical and to the Final
Utility school. His charming book, <i>The Theory of Political Economy</i>, dates from
1871.</p>

<p>Léon Walras, who is persistently spoken of as a Swiss economist just because
he happened to spend the greater part of his life at the University of Lausanne,
also known as the School of Lausanne, was in reality a Frenchman. His <i>Éléments
d’Économie politique pure</i>, of which the first part appeared in 1874, contains a full
exposition of Mathematical economics.</p>

<p>To-day the Mathematical method can claim representatives in every country:
Marshall and Edgeworth in England, Launhardt, Auspitz, and Lieben in Germany,
Vilfredo Pareto and Barone in Italy, Irving Fisher in the United States, and
Bortkevitch in Russia. France, however, the country of Cournot and Walras,
has no Mathematical economists, unless we mention Aupetit whose work, <i>Théorie
de la Monnaie</i>, although dealing with a special subject, contains a general
introduction.</p>

the new school, and thus it loses all its subjectivity; and since it is not a thing at
all, but merely an expression, it would be ridiculous to struggle to find its cause,
foundation, or nature, as the older writers did. This is why Jevons proposed to
banish the word altogether and to employ the term “ratio of exchange” instead.
And Aupetit insists that “the expression ‘value’ is to-day devoid of content …
and seems doomed to disappear from the scientific vocabulary altogether. There
is no great harm in omitting this parasitical element as we have done, and
in treating economic equilibrium as an entity without ever employing the term
‘value.’” (<i>Théorie de la Monnaie</i>, p. 85.)</p>

Cournot, who refers to it as the law of sale, gives an admirable illustration
of its operation in the case of bottles of medicinal waters of wonderful
curative power. At a very low price the demand and consequently the sale
would be very great, though not infinite because of the limit which exists
for each want. At a very high price it would be <i>nil</i>. Between the two extremes
would be several intermediate curves. We cannot deal with all the ingenious
deductions which Cournot makes concerning monopoly and the greater or lesser
discord between monopoly and the general interest.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1124" id="Footnote_1124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1124"><span class="label">[1124]</span></a> The demand curve is generally concave, and this characteristic form is
just the geometrical expression of the well-known fact that when prices are low
enough to be accessible to everybody the sales increase rapidly, because lean
purses being much more numerous than fat ones a slight lowering of the level of
prices will bring the commodity within the reach of a fresh stratum of people. It
may take different forms, however. For some products, such as common salt, a
considerable fall in the price will not result in a large increase in the sales. In
the case of diamonds a great fall in price may cause a falling off in demand because
they have become too cheap. The supply curve, on the other hand, is generally
convex, because the supply, which only enters upon the scene at a certain point,
is very sensible to price movements, going up rapidly with a slight increase in
price. Its upward trend is soon arrested, however, because production cannot
keep up the pace. It is even possible that the supply may fall off at the
next point, for the simple reason that there is no more of the commodity
available.</p>

<p>The figures along the horizontal line denote price, along the vertical the
quantity demanded. In the given figure when price is 1, quantity demanded is
VI, and with the price at 7 the quantity demanded falls to zero.</p>

<p>The dotted curve represents the supply. When price is 1, supply is <i>nil</i>.
When price is 10, supply mounts up to IV. Exchange obviously must take
place just where demand and supply are equal, <i>i.e.</i> at <i>b</i>, which marks the point
of intersection of the two lines, when the amount demanded is equal to the
quantity offered and the price is 5.</p>

<p>The vertical lines are called ordinates, and 0 X the axis of the ordinates.
Distances along 0 X are called abscissæ. Each point on the curve simply marks
the intersection of these, of the ordinates and the abscissæ. This is true of the
point <i>a</i>, for example, where the perpendicular denotes the price (1) and the other
line the number of units sold, in this case VI.</p>

<p>Though in the diagram we have considered the ordinates to represent price
and the abscissæ quantities, the reverse notation would work equally well.</p>

much more complicated and not quite so important perhaps, relating as they do

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1127" id="Footnote_1127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1127"><span class="label">[1127]</span></a> Note Pareto’s terms of appreciation (<i>Économie pure</i>, 1902, p. 11): “Walras
was the first to show the importance of these equations, especially in the
case of free competition. This capital discovery entitles him to all the praise
that we can give him. The science has developed a good deal since then, and
will undoubtedly develop still more in the future, but that will not take away from
the importance of Walras’s discovery. Astronomy has progressed very considerably
since Newton published his <i>Principia</i>, but far from detracting from
the merits of the earlier work it has rather enhanced its reputation.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1128" id="Footnote_1128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1128"><span class="label">[1128]</span></a> If this is to be taken as literally true, we have this curious result: the
<i>entrepreneur</i>, receiving for the products which he sells just exactly what he paid
for producing them, makes no profit at all.</p>

<p>Both Walras and Pareto fully admit the paradoxical nature of the statement.
Of course it is understood that it can only happen under a <i>régime</i> of perfectly
free competition, care being also taken to distinguish between profits and interest,
a thing that is never done, apparently, by English economists, who treat
both interest and profit as constituent elements of cost of production.</p>

<p>But this is not so wonderful as it seems at first sight. It simply means a
return to the well-known formula that under a <i>régime</i> of free competition selling
price must necessarily coincide with cost of production.</p>

<p>This does not prevent our recognising the existence of actual profits. Profits
are to be regarded as the result of incessant oscillations of a system round some
fixed point with which it never has the good fortune actually to coincide. According
to this conception they are but the waves of the sea. But the existence of
waves is no reason for denying a mean level of the ocean or for not taking that
mean level as a basis for measuring other heights. Some day, perhaps, equilibrium
will become a fact, and profits will vanish. But if that day ever does dawn
either upon the physical or the economic world, all activity will suddenly cease,
and the world itself will come to a standstill.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1129" id="Footnote_1129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1129"><span class="label">[1129]</span></a> A full exposition of Walras’s system involves the supposition not only of
two but of three markets interwoven together. On the actual market where
goods are exchanged the quantity of these commodities depends upon the
quantity of productive services, land, capital, and labour, and the quantity of these
productive services, at least the quantity of capital, depends to a certain extent
upon the creation of new capital, which in turn depends upon the amount of
saving. The third market, then, is that of capitalisation. Since the new capital
can only be paid for out of savings, <i>i.e.</i> out of that part of the revenue which
has been employed in other ways than in buying consumable commodities, the price
of capital must be such as to equal the quantity saved and the quantity of new
capital demanded. If saving exceeds the demand the price will fall, etc.</p>

<p>To say that the price of capital has gone up is to say that the rate of interest
or the reward of saving has fallen. But a fall in the rate of interest will check
saving. The result will be a change of equilibrium, the price of new capital
will fall, the rate of interest will go up, etc.</p>

<p>Briefly, then, the total maximum utilities on the one hand and the price on
the other, these are the two conditions determining equilibrium in the economic
world, no matter whether it be products or services or capital. “The same
thing is true of gravity in the physical world, which varies directly with the
mass and inversely with the square of the distance. Such is the twofold condition
which determines the movement of the celestial bodies.… In both
cases the whole science may be represented by a formula consisting of only two
lines. Such a formula will include a great number of facts.” (Walras, <i>Économie
politique pure</i>, p. 306.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1130" id="Footnote_1130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1130"><span class="label">[1130]</span></a> Professor Edgeworth employs a similar comparison, speaking of the
economic man as a charioteer and of social science as consisting of a chariot
and some such charioteer (<i>Mathematical Psychics</i>, p. 15). “‘Mécanique Sociale’
may one day take her place along with ‘Mécanique Céleste,’ throned each upon
the double-sided height of one maximum principle, the supreme pinnacle of
moral as of physical science.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 12.)</p>

<p>Pareto regards political economy as a study of the balance between desires
and the obstacles which stand in the way of their satisfaction.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1131" id="Footnote_1131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1131"><span class="label">[1131]</span></a> During the last few years we have had, of course, M. Colson’s great book on
political economy, which contains a mathematical treatment of demand and
supply, M. Landry’s exposition of the Austrian theory in his <i>Manuel d’Économique</i>,
and M. Antonelli giving a special course on Walras’s system at the Collège
libre des Sciences sociales. We have already referred to Aupetit’s book on money.
We must also mention the translations of the <i>Manual of Political Economy</i> of
Vilfredo Pareto and of Jevons’s <i>Theory of Political Economy</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1132" id="Footnote_1132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1132"><span class="label">[1132]</span></a> M. Paul Leroy-Beaulieu is particularly severe upon the Mathematical
method. “It is a pure delusion and a hollow mockery. It has no scientific
foundation and is of no practical use. It is as much a gamble as the scramble for
prizes at the table at Monte Carlo.… The so-called curve of utility or demand
is of no earthly use, for if the price of wine goes up the consumption of beer or
cider will increase, that is all.” (<i>Traité d’Économie politique</i>, vol. i, p. 85; vol. iii,
p. 62.)</p>

<p>This last criticism is somewhat unexpected, for we have already seen that the
Hedonists are very far indeed from ignoring the law of substitution. If they did
not actually discover it they immensely amplified it. And it is very probable
that if there had been a contradiction between their doctrines and this law it
would not have escaped them. Moreover, we note that beer and cider have their
demand curves: cannot wine have one as well? Having to pass from one to
the other does undoubtedly complicate matters, and the Mathematical economist
frequently finds himself obliged to juggle not with one but with two or three balls.
But this is just the kind of difficulty which is amenable to mathematical treatment—nay,
even, perhaps, demands it. The connection between the values of
complementary or supplementary goods is one of the problems that has been
most thoroughly investigated by the Hedonists. See Pantaleoni, <i>Economia pura</i>.</p>

is very critical in the fourth edition of his <i>Économie pure</i>. M. A. Landez in his
<i>Intérêt du Capital</i> (1904) and Irving Fisher in <i>The Rate of Interest</i> (1907) have tried
if not to demolish it at least to correct it by giving a more subtle analysis of the
motives determining a preference for a future income as compared with a present
one. This time-preference, of course, varies according to the fortune of each and

is another respect in which the Hedonists have shown themselves faithful to the
Classical tradition. The necessity for separating the art from the science of
political economy, pure economics from applied, was especially emphasised by
Courcelle-Seneuil and Cherbuliez. Pareto put it well when he said that the
maximum of ophelimity can be put in the shape of an equation, but the maximum
of justice can not.</p>

it would facilitate the establishment of free trade, which is an ideal of the science.
The chief difficulties would thus be avoided, such as unequal import duties and
unequal degree of fertility. “Free trade has always involved the absence of
duties, and the nationalisation of land would further result in the free movement
of capital and labour to whatever place might prove most advantageous to
them.” (<i>La Paix par la Justice sociale et par le Libre-Échange</i>, in <i>Questions

method is by no means confined to one school. Professor Clark employs it, and

trust to the efficacy of free competition. But Professor Patten also makes use of
it, and he is an interventionist of the extreme type.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1154" id="Footnote_1154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1154"><span class="label">[1154]</span></a> This fact was noted by Hermann even as far back as 1832 in his very
remarkable <i>Staatswirtschaftliche Untersuchungen</i> (Munich, 1832), p. 166: “A
phenomenon that is exactly analogous to rent becomes manifest whenever a
country employs imported machinery the multiplication of which is difficult,
possibly because the producing country discourages such exportation. [Such
was the case with English machinery at the time Hermann wrote.] … Suppose
now that the price of the commodity manufactured with the aid of such machinery
goes up. If the country under consideration can only manufacture with machinery
that is more expensive but less efficient because of its defective character,
the cost of production will still be higher than if the best [foreign] machinery
were employed. The result is that the proprietors of the latter retain such
advantages as the rise in price had secured them.” Mangoldt (in <i>Die Lehre
vom Unternehmergewinn</i>, Leipzig, 1855) expresses his view in a somewhat similar
fashion: “Rent shows itself clearest and on the largest scale in the case of
agricultural land, but it is equally evident wherever the difficulty of multiplying
capital prevails or where it can only be replaced by other capital of a more expensive
character or a less productive yield.” Ricardo himself possibly had the
rent of capital in mind when he said: “The exchangeable value of all commodities,
whether they be manufactured or the produce of the mines or the
produce of land, is always regulated, not by the less quantity of labour that
ill suffice for their production under circumstances highly favourable, and
exclusively enjoyed by those who have peculiar facilities of production, but
by the greater quantity of labour necessarily bestowed on their production by
those who have no such facilities, by those who contrive to produce them under
the most unfavourable circumstances—meaning by the most unfavourable circumstances
the most unfavourable under which the quantity of produce required
renders it necessary to carry on the production.” (<i>Principles</i>, p. 37.) English
writers, however, seldom speak of the rent of capital. Rent with them always
signifies income due, not to the intervention of man, but to the natural resources
of production.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1158" id="Footnote_1158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1158"><span class="label">[1158]</span></a> Walker is one of the first of the English-speaking economists to make this
distinction and to employ the term “profit” in a narrow sense, distinguishing
it from interest on the one hand and wages on the other. He even went so far
as to subtract the wages of superintendence and direction because this work
of supervision could be delegated to others (<i>Wages Question</i>, 2nd ed., 1891,
pp. 230, etc.), while the special function performed by the <i>entrepreneur</i>, namely,
the adaptation of supply to demand, requires special remuneration, which he
proposes to call profit. It is a little odd that a writer who seemed completely
isolated should be shown, after all, to share the views of other economists.
Walker declares that save his own father, Amasa Walker, he knew of no economist
who had distinguished between capitalist and <i>entrepreneur</i>. But J. B. Say had
already made the same distinction, which had been adopted by all Continental
economists even as far back as the beginning of the nineteenth century.</p>

and to organise and control the industrial machinery.” (<i>The Wages Question</i>,

<p><a name="Footnote_1164" id="Footnote_1164"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1164"><span class="label">[1164]</span></a> Pantaleoni makes the same distinction: “Profits,” says he, “may be the
result of superior ability acquired either by assiduous study or prolonged preparation.
In that case we are dealing, not with a kind of rent, but with a species
of profit which may be very remunerative but which is nevertheless amenable to
a very different law from that which generally regulates the investment of capital.”
(<i>Economia pura</i>, Part III, chap. 4.) On the other hand, Pantaleoni refuses
to recognise the existence of an element of insurance against risk as an item in
profits, because, as he points out, if the premium has been carefully reckoned up
and compared with the risk, “it ought on an average to be equal to it at the
end of a certain number of years, so that the net rent would become equal to
zero.” (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

this composite rent either to the landlord or to the capitalist from whom he
has borrowed his capital or to the workers by whose superior ability he has
benefited. The difficult question of determining what proportion ought to
be given in this way is discussed by Marshall in his <i>Principles</i>, Book V, chap. 10,

<p><a name="Footnote_1173" id="Footnote_1173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1173"><span class="label">[1173]</span></a> Ricardo had already made use of the following argument: “Suppose that
the demand is for a million of quarters of corn, and that they are the produce
of the land actually in cultivation. Now, suppose the fertility of all the land
to be so diminished that the very same lands will yield only 900,000 quarters.
The demand being for a million of quarters, the price of corn would rise, and
recourse must necessarily be had to land of an inferior quality sooner than if
the superior land had continued to produce a million of quarters.” (<i>Principles</i>,
chap. 32, p. 246.) Towards the end of his life Ricardo seems to have been more
favourably inclined to a conception of rent somewhat closer akin to J. B.
Say’s. Compare the curious quotations given in Frézouls, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 21.</p>

under the most disadvantageous circumstances of its production; but only
when it is, for the time, in the condition of those commodities which are absolutely
limited in supply, and is therefore selling at a scarcity value—which
never is, nor has been, nor can be a permanent condition of any of the great
rent-yielding commodities.” (<i>Principles</i>, Book III, chap. 5, § 4.) For the
position with regard to mines see the same chapter, § 3.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1175" id="Footnote_1175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1175"><span class="label">[1175]</span></a> In this case Stuart Mill seems to compare rent to a monopoly revenue:
“A thing which is limited in quantity, even though its possessors do not act in
concert, is still a monopolised article.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, Book II, chap. 16, § 2.) The
expression, though adopted by several other writers, is not quite accurate.
In the case of a monopoly the owners fix the quantity which they will produce
beforehand with a view to getting a maximum of profit. But this cannot apply to
landowners. At any rate, if there is any monopoly it must be an incomplete one.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1177" id="Footnote_1177"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1177"><span class="label">[1177]</span></a> Such was the argument employed by J. B. Say in the course of a controversy
with Ricardo. “It is perfectly obvious that if the needs of society raise
the price of corn to such a level as to permit of the cultivation of inferior lands
which yield nothing beyond wages for the workmen and profits on the capital,
then that demand on the part of society, coupled with the price which it can
afford to pay for the corn, allows of a profit on the most fertile or best situated
lands.” (<i>Traité</i>, 6th edition, p. 410.) Continuing, he remarks: “David Ricardo
in the same chapter clearly shows that the profit from land is not the cause but
the effect of the demand for corn, and the reasons which he adduces in support
of this view may be turned against him to prove that other items in cost of
production, notably the wages of labour, are not the cause but the effect of the
current price of goods.” Ricardo himself seemed on the point of being converted
to this view. See <a href="#Page_554">p. 554, note 2</a>.</p>

(Tübingen)—a work in which he attempts a justification of rents in general
and of the rent of land in particular. Rent he regards as the reward offered
to anyone who knows how to utilise either his personal capacity or his capital
or land in a way that is particularly advantageous to society. It supplies
an allurement that acts as the source of all progress and of all economic activity,
a sort of natural right of ownership which society spontaneously confers upon
those individuals who know how to serve society, and which competition causes
to disappear at the opportune moment. The rent of land can be justified on
this ground wherever legislation has not made an abuse of it. This new claim
on behalf of rent is very interesting, and those who regard rent as exclusively
unearned increment may ponder over this new characteristic of unearned
incomes.</p>

sum paid for the use of other kinds of capital—a machine, for example. Although
the land or the machine has to be returned to its rightful owner in the same
condition as it was received, one ought to pay something just because such
capitals are economically scarce; in other words, the amount existing at any
one time or place is not greater than the demand. What differentiates land
from machinery is that savings might easily be employed in turning out new
machinery, but cannot very well increase the quantity of land in existence, or
at any rate cannot transform existing soils in a manner that is profitable.”
(Pareto, <i>Cours d’Économie politique</i>, vol. ii, § 759.) Marshall makes use of
analogous terms: “If the supply of any factor of production is limited, and
incapable of much increase by man’s effort in any given period of time, then the
income to be derived from it is to be regarded as of the nature of rent rather
than profits in inquiries as to the action of economic causes during that period;
although for longer periods it may rightly be regarded as profits which are
required to cover part of the expenses of production and which therefore directly
enter into those expenses.” (<i>Principles</i>, 1st ed., Book VI, chap. 3, § 1.)</p>

of the doctrine of rent, which is to be found in Clark’s <i>Distribution
of Wealth</i>, published in 1899. In that work, upon the strength of which
the author enjoys a well-deserved reputation, revenues of various kinds are
successively treated as rents. Imagine a fixed amount of capital applied
along with successive doses of labour: each new dose of labour will produce
less than the preceding one, while the production of the last dose regulates
the remuneration of all the rest. But the product of the preceding doses is
greater than that of the last, and a surplus value will be produced which will
represent the product of capital and which will be exactly analogous to rent.
Or suppose, on the other hand, that the quantity of labour is fixed and applied
along with successive doses of capital; the productivity of the latter will in
this case go on decreasing, and since the revenue of each dose will be proportionate
to its productivity, any surplus left over will be of the nature of rent
due to labour. There are other ingenious discussions which cannot be referred
to in a note of this kind. But in our opinion the theory of economic equilibrium
affords a simpler explanation of distribution, and the kind of optimism to which
Clark’s theory gives rise seems hardly justified. His attempt to combine the
idea of marginal productivity with the law of diminishing returns is a further
proof of the persistent influence exerted by Ricardian ideas upon English-speaking
economists.</p>

labour, the raw material of the earth.” Walras, in his <i>Théorie de la Propriété</i>,

exertion. Capital is produced by labour; it is, in fact, but labour impressed
upon matter.… The use of capital in production is, therefore, but a mode
of labour.… Hence the principle that, under circumstances which permit free
competition, operates to bring wages to a common standard and profits to a
substantial equality—the principle that men will seek to gratify their desires
with the least exertion—operates to establish and maintain this equilibrium
between wages and interest.… And this relation fixed, it is evident that
interest and wages must rise and fall together, and that interest cannot be
increased without increasing wages, nor wages be lowered without depressing
interest.” (<i>Progress and Poverty</i>, Book III, chap. 5.) It is hardly necessary
to point out how very much simplified this doctrine concerning the relation
between wages and interest really is.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1203" id="Footnote_1203"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1203"><span class="label">[1203]</span></a> A <i>résumé</i> of this theory of distribution, whose very simplicity must make
it suspect, may be found in Book V, chap. 2: “In every direction, the direct
tendency of advancing civilisation is to increase the power of human labour
to satisfy human desires—to extirpate poverty and to banish want and the
fear of want.… But labour cannot reap the benefits which advancing
civilisation thus brings, because they are intercepted. Land being necessary to
labour, and being reduced to private ownership, every increase in the productive
power of labour but increases rent—the price that labour must pay for the
opportunity to utilise its power; and thus all the advantages gained by the
march of progress go to the owners of land, and wages do not increase.”
George, however, does not claim that real wages have fallen because technical
improvements enable production to be carried on where it was formerly impossible.
At most this will only enable capital and labour to preserve their old
scale of remuneration; it will not give them any share in the progress that
has been made, so that, relatively speaking, it is true to say that wages and
interest have both fallen in comparison with rent. “When I say that wages
fall as rent rises, I do not mean that the quantity of wealth obtained by labourers
as wages is necessarily less, but that the proportion which it bears to the whole
produce is necessarily less. The proportion may diminish while the quantity
remains the same, or even increases.” (Book VI, chap. 6. Cf. also Book IV,
chap. 3.) George, like Ricardo and a good many socialists, confuses two different
problems, namely, the price of productive services and the proportional distribution
of the product between the different agents of production (Book V).
He adds, however, that scientific discovery, by pushing the margin of cultivation
back to that point where the law of diminishing returns is more than
counterbalanced by increased productive efficiency, may even sometimes reduce
the worker’s real wages, and so impair his position not only relatively, but also
absolutely. (Book IV, chap. 4.)</p>

the land at a price which depends upon two contrary conditions (gain or loss)
establishes a kind of equilibrium. The State would not lose anything by this,
for a fall in value in one place, unless it be accompanied by a general want of
prosperity, implies a corresponding increase somewhere else, of which the State
will get the benefit. (<i>Dissertations and Discussions</i>, vol. iv.)</p>

(Turin, 1902), remarks that this principle of indemnifying losses leads directly
to a State guarantee of values—the expediency of which is at least problematic.
He makes the further observation that the compensation would often be paid
to a person other than the one who paid the tax when it was levied—the property
in the meantime having changed hands.</p>

above passage, “when limited to its essential elements, consists in the recognition,
in each person, of a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have produced
by their own efforts, or received either by gift or by fair agreement without
force or fraud from those who produced it.” Such a definition at least implies
that landed property is illegal. A house is distinguished from the land upon
which it is built; whereas the former is legally held the latter is not.</p>

result of the improvements already mentioned in this Act—through the making

or other public works—any private property acquires a notable increase in
value, such property shall be made to pay an indemnity which may be equal to
half the value of the advantage which has thus accrued to it.” The principle was
rarely applied, however. M. Berthélemy (<i>Traité élémentaire de Droit administratif</i>,

simplified. (3) Producers would be exempted from buying land and from keeping
capital for this purpose. (4) Rent would take the place of taxation to a very
considerable extent, and would free the collection of it from every trace of vexation
or injustice. (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 273.)</p>

landed proprietors, it is hardly necessary to invoke the fact that rents have a
faculty of growing continuously without the co-operation of the proprietor. We
need scarcely point out that this increase in rent over a certain period cannot
enter into the price of land simply because it cannot be calculated. Consequently,
when a buyer buys under the system of guarantee afforded by the
State he has at the same time undoubtedly bought a claim to all the variations
of rent which may ensue.… Even if the landed proprietor is indemnified by
being paid a perpetual rent equal to the rent of his land at the time of confiscation,
as is done to-day in the case of compulsory purchase, the injustice will
not be as great as it otherwise would be, but it will not be removed altogether.”

to think that hardly a buyer would be found who would refuse such an offer
coupled with a slight compensation, for ninety-nine years is the equivalent of
perpetuity as far as the individual is concerned. There would be nothing mean
about such a price; really it would be more of a gift to the proprietor.”</p>

upon the masters, which is one cause of poverty. The worker who possesses

wages will surely rise, for no one will work for another unless he can get more

<p><a name="Footnote_1227" id="Footnote_1227"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1227"><span class="label">[1227]</span></a> If we had not decided against the inclusion of the Italian economists,
this would have been the place to devote a few words to the writings of Achille
Loria. No one excels him as a writer on political economy. An elaborate
superstructure of great economic, political, social, and even religious significance
has been built upon the foundation of free land, which at least denotes a powerful
imagination. A <i>résumé</i> of this thesis is contained in <i>La Terra ed il Sistema
sociale</i>, translated for the <i>Revue d’Économie politique</i> in 1892. We cannot
examine Loria’s system here. Suffice it to say that in his <i>Costituzione economica
odierna</i> (1900) he demands that the law should recognise each man’s right to
the land: either to a unit of land (<i>i.e.</i> a quantity of land such as would enable
a man to live and set up as an independent producer) or, failing that, to a fraction
of such a unit.</p>

<p>Such is the theoretical solution, but the practical suggestion is somewhat
milder, a kind of territorial wage being suggested. Every master would be
obliged to give to his workmen, in addition to a minimum wage, a certain amount
of land at the end of a given number of years. If during that period the workman
has been employed by several masters, each master should contribute in
proportion to the length of time he has been in his service.</p>

<p>At the end of a certain period every worker would thus become a proprietor.
These would thus be in the same position as their primitive ancestors were
as far as natural economy is concerned, and would be able to join with the
older proprietors in a kind of association of capital and labour on a footing of
absolute equality, which Signor Loria thought would be a most fruitful type of
organisation. During the intervening years a certain amount of pressure would
have to be put upon the proprietors.</p>

and conduct of the necessary industries of the country, and the appropriation
of all forms of economic rent of land and capital by the nation as a whole, through
the most suitable public authorities, municipal, provincial, or central. The
socialism advocated by the Fabian Society is State socialism exclusively (the
term is used to distinguish it from anarchist socialism). On the other hand, it
“steadfastly discountenances all schemes for securing to any person, or any
group of persons, the entire product of their labour. It recognises that wealth
is social in its origin and must be social in its distribution, since the evolution
of industry has made it impossible to distinguish the particular contribution
that each person makes to the common product, or to ascertain its value.”

beyond the means of subsistence according to the current local standard. The
additional product, determined by the relative differences in productive efficiency
of the different sites, soils, capitals, and forms of skill above the margin of
cultivation, has gone to those exercising control over these valuable but scarce
productive factors. This struggle to secure the surplus or ‘economic rent’ is
the key to the confused history of European progress, and an underlying,

by the Roman jurists to signify the obligation incurred by debtors who were
each held responsible for the whole amount of a debt. One would naturally
expect the French derivative to be <i>solidité</i>, which was the term used by the
jurists under the old <i>régime</i>, especially by Pothier. <i>Solidarité</i> was substituted
for it by the editors of the Civil Code.</p>

the merits of solidarity are set forth. We must content ourselves with the
following, chosen at random:</p>

<p>M. Millerand, at the time Minister of Commerce, in a speech delivered at
the opening of the Exposition Universelle in 1900, said: “Science teaches men
the true secret of material greatness and of social morality; and all its teaching,
in a word, points to solidarity.”</p>

<p>M. Deherme, the founder of the People’s University movement, says: “The
folly of solidarity should be the source of our inspiration, just as the martyrs
of old were inspired by the folly of the Cross. The thing that wants doing is
to organise democracy.” (<i>La Co-operation des Idées</i>, June 16, 1900.)</p>

the same office; so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
members one of another.” (Romans xii, 4 and 5.)</p>

<p>“As in physical organisms the unity is made up of separate limbs, so among
reasoning things the reason is distributed among individuals constituted for unity
of co-operation.” (Marcus Aurelius, vii, 13; Rendall’s translation.)</p>

work <i>Bau und Leben des sozialen Körpers</i> (1875-78); possibly from the publication
of Rodbertus’s work—at any rate, Rodbertus accuses Schäffle of plagiarism. See
also Spencer’s <i>Principles of Sociology</i>. Aristotle had already ventured to say
that “an animal is just like a well-ordered city,” a proposition that might well
be inverted.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1256" id="Footnote_1256"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1256"><span class="label">[1256]</span></a> It was in 1889, if we mistake not, that the term “solidarity” was proposed
as the title of a new economic school in a lecture entitled <i>L’École nouvelle</i>. This
lecture was published, along with others, in a small volume entitled <i>Quatre Écoles
d’Économie sociale</i> (1890, Geneva) (<i>L’École libérale</i>, by Frédéric Passy; <i>L’École
catholique</i>, by Claudio Jannet; <i>L’École socialiste</i> by M. Stiegler; and <i>L’École
nouvelle</i>, by M. Gide). The characteristics of the various schools are summed
up as follows: The one is the school of liberty, the other of authority,
while the third is the school of equality. Gide then proceeds: “Were I asked
to define what I understand by the New School in a single word, I should call
it the Solidarity School. Unlike liberty, equality, and fraternity, solidarity
is not a very high-sounding word, nor is it a mere ideal. It is just a fact, one
of the best-established facts of history and experience, and the most important
discovery of our time, and this fact of solidarity is becoming better established
every day.”</p>

<p>It would have been better, perhaps, to have spoken of a new movement
rather than of a new school, seeing the variety of schools, some of them actually
opposed to one another, such as the school of Biological Naturalism and the
Christian school, the Anarchist school and the State Socialist school, that have
adopted solidarity as a part of their creed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1257" id="Footnote_1257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1257"><span class="label">[1257]</span></a> M. Léon Bourgeois’s <i>La Solidarité</i> appeared originally as a series of articles
contributed to the <i>Nouvelle Revue</i> in 1896. These were published in book form
in the following year. The different aspects of the question have been dealt
with in a series of lectures delivered by various authors at the École des Hautes
Études sociales under the presidency of M. Bourgeois himself, and published in
a volume entitled <i>Essai d’une Philosophie de la Solidarité</i> (1902). An association
for the propagation of the new ideas was founded in 1895 under the name of La
Société d’Éducation sociale. An International Congress was called together on the
occasion of the 1900 Exposition, but since then the signs of activity have been few.</p>

<p>French books and articles dealing with the subject are plentiful enough.
We can only mention <i>La Solidarité sociale et ses Nouvelles Formules</i>, by M.
d’Eichthal (1903); the annual report of L’Académie des Sciences morales et
politiques for 1903; M. Bouglé’s book <i>Le Solidarisme</i> (1907); and Fleurant’s
<i>La Solidarité</i> (1907). There is hardly a manual for teachers published which
does not contain a chapter devoted to this question.</p>

taken to imply that it must necessarily be just. Justice can never be realised
unless the laws of solidarity are first observed; but once these have been
established, their effects must be modified to make them conform to the requirements
of justice. The actual and the ideal should never be confused; they are
the direct contraries of one another. But it is absolutely necessary that the
first should be established before we can realise the moral necessity for the
other.” (Bourgeois, <i>Philosophie de la Solidarité</i>, pp. 13, 17.)</p>

be paid all the same.” (Bourgeois, <i>Philosophie de la Solidarité</i>, p. 60.) “There is a
real claim where we thought there was only a moral obligation, and a debt where
we thought there was only a sacrifice.” As the Gospel says: “Unto whomsoever
much is given, of him shall be much required.” (Luke xii, 48.) “So
that ye come behind in no gift.” (1 Corinthians i, 7.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1261" id="Footnote_1261"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1261"><span class="label">[1261]</span></a> M. Bourgeois also points out that just as our ancestors were indebted to
us, so are we indebted to those that shall come after us. But that is a different
thing, and the theory does not seem very sound on this point. It is strange
to think that creditors long since dead should transfer the debt which was owing
to them to the credit of generations yet unborn!</p>

Article 1370, in addition to the cases of quasi-contract and quasi-misdemeanour
of which it speaks, also mentions “law” as a general cause of obligation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1264" id="Footnote_1264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1264"><span class="label">[1264]</span></a> “Wherever it is impossible to fix definitely the value of the personal effort
put forth by a single individual, as in the case of a quasi-contract—that is,
whenever it is impossible to determine the value of the debt on the one hand or
the credit on the other—<i>the best plan is to pool those risks and advantages</i>. This
would mean that none would know who is really bearing the risk or who is
reaping the advantages, the risks being shared by everybody and the advantages
being thrown open to everyone.” (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 81.)</p>

<p>The end of the quotation apparently contradicts the statement we have
italicised, in which he speaks of pooling risks and advantages. With regard to
the latter, it is enough, apparently, to secure equal opportunity. It is not very
obvious why the principle should be so rigidly enforced in the one case and so
reluctantly in the other. If the principle of solidarity holds me responsible for
the degradation of the drunkard in the one case, is there any reason why I
should not be allowed to share in the good fortune of the lucky speculator in
another? Is it because the logical application of this principle would directly
lead to communism?</p>

by M. Bourgeois as it is by his disciples. As in many another instance, the

philosopher Charles Secrétan, in his book <i>La Civilisation et la Croyance</i>, and
the same point of view has been adopted by M. Alfred Fouillée. “Solidarity,”
writes Fouillée, “has all the practical value of an ideal force. The recognition
of the profound identity which pervades humanity and the adoption of an ideal
of perfect unity as the supreme object of rational desire must assume the form
of a duty in the eyes of every human being. We should anticipate the unity
of the human race, which is as yet far from being realised, and which will never
be perfect perhaps, by acting as if we were already one.” (<i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i>, July 15, 1901.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1273" id="Footnote_1273"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1273"><span class="label">[1273]</span></a> These laws of public assistance are among the most remarkable practical
manifestations of the solidarist movement. They are quite a new feature in
French public life, and until their appearance relief, whether given by the State,
the department, or the commune, was purely optional (except in a few isolated
cases, such as in that of waifs and strays). To mention only the principal ones in
France, the law of July 15, 1893, made relief in the form of medical attendance for
all destitute invalids obligatory upon the communes. The law of July 14, 1905,
extended a similar benefit to all invalids and to all persons over seventy years
of age in the form of pensions varying in amount from 60 to 240 francs per
annum (360 in Paris). Finally, the law of April 5, 1910, secures a pension to all
workmen at the age of sixty, the charge being divided between the State, the
employers, and the workmen themselves. It is a kind of payment made by the
members of the present generation to the survivors of a past one. This relief is
clearly of the nature of a social debt, and justifies us in treating it as the outcome
of a quasi-contract, for on the one hand it constitutes an obligation fixed
by law on the part of the commune, the department, or the State, as the case
may be—an obligation which they cannot escape—and on the other hand a right
on the part of the beneficiary, as in the case of a creditor in an action for the
recovery of debt.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1274" id="Footnote_1274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1274"><span class="label">[1274]</span></a> A very curious application of this national solidarity has come to light
quite recently. Formerly the French Government would only sanction foreign
loans if the borrowing country promised to apply some part of its funds to French
industry. That meant linking the <i>rentier</i> and the French manufacturers by a
forced kind of solidarity, the first being unwilling to lend money unless that
money in some way returned to the second person for goods purchased. This
is just where the claim of the workers, who justly demand a minimum wage,
comes in.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1275" id="Footnote_1275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1275"><span class="label">[1275]</span></a> The doctrine of quasi-contract might lead to the one conclusion as well
as to the other. M. Bourgeois himself seems to incline rather in the direction
of associationism. “The Radical party has a social doctrine, a doctrine that
might be summed up in one word—association.” (Preface to M. Buisson’s

<p><a name="Footnote_1277" id="Footnote_1277"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1277"><span class="label">[1277]</span></a> Mutualists are so taken up with the idea of solidarity that they indignantly
protest if any of their number happens to make use of the term “beneficence” or
“charity.” “Everyone has a right to demand his own,” they say: that is
clearly Bourgeois’s thesis. On the other hand, their journal, <i>L’Avenir de la
Mutualité</i>, for February 1909 claims that societies for mutual help have a right to
organise tombolas and lotteries, and they base their care upon the law of May 21,
1836, which reserves the right of lottery to “efforts of an entirely charitable
character.” In order to defend its claim, <i>L’Avenir de la Mutualité</i> does not
hesitate to affirm that the societies for mutual help “recognise the existence of
an element of benevolence which is not exactly mutual and which is rightly
connected with the superior modern principle of social solidarity, but which
none the less justifies the application of the law of 1836.”</p>

<p>“The most unmistakable manifestation of solidarity consists in the employment
of a part of the wealth produced by labour in order to repair the poverty
caused by the deficient organisation of labour, which leaves the worker and his
family liable to the acutest suffering whenever illness, old age, or misfortune
crosses their paths.” (Programme on the cover of a journal known as <i>L’Association

<p><a name="Footnote_1279" id="Footnote_1279"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1279"><span class="label">[1279]</span></a> This co-operatist programme is generally known in France as that of
the École de Nîmes. Really it is a development of the suggestions thrown
out by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844. M. Bourgeois, who gives it a place
in his <i>Systèmes socialistes</i>, considers that it is a little indefinite. It seems to
us, on the other hand, to be about as precise as any of the other socialist
systems that attempt to envisage the future; and it has this advantage, that its
prophecies are already in process of realisation in a fashion that is most unmistakable.
See a brief <i>résumé</i> of the programme in a lecture by Gide on the
occasion of the centenary of the French Revolution, published in the volume
entitled <i>Co-opération (Des Transformations que la Co-opération est appelée à
réaliser dans l’Ordre économique)</i>.</p>

<p>The task of reorganising society belongs, not to the producers, but to the
consumers, for while the former are inspired by the co-operative spirit, the latter
are imbued with enthusiasm for the general well-being. Consumers have only
to unite and all their wants are satisfied just in the way they desire, for they can
either buy directly from the producers all that they need, or they can, when
they have become sufficiently rich and powerful, produce for themselves in
their own factories and on their own lands. This would mean the abolition of
all profits, those of middlemen and manufacturers alike. The societies would
retain only as much as would be necessary for the further extension of the movement,
returning all the rest to the consumers in proportion to the amount of
their purchases. We have already had occasion to note how this idea of the
abolition of profits had haunted John Stuart Mill, and how it seemed linked
with an entirely new phase of social evolution, to which he gave the name of
the “stationary State.” We have also witnessed the Hedonists’ arrival at
exactly the same conclusion, though along a directly opposite path, namely,
that of absolutely free competition.</p>

<p>We must not lose sight of the fact that this revolution is accomplished
without affecting the foundations of the social order—property, inheritance,
interest, etc.—and without having recourse to any measure of expropriation save
such as naturally results from the free play of present economic laws. Co-operators
have no desire to interfere with accumulated capital, their aim being
merely to form new capital which shall render the old useless. If existing
capital is merely accumulated profits made out of labour, why should not labour
itself make a profit, and this time keep it for its own use?</p>

<p>Complaints have been made that a system of this kind, even if it were realised,
would not result in the abolition of the wage-earner, seeing that the workers
would still be employed, the only difference being that their employer would
be a society instead of an individual. The reply is that a person who works
for a society of which he himself is a member is very near to being his own
master.</p>

<p>Moreover, has anyone a right to raise this objection? The upholder of the
present economic order certainly has not when we remember that he considers
the wage contract to be the definite type of pure contract. Neither are the collectivists
entitled to make it, for under their system everybody would be a civil
servant. Hence the only persons who are really justified in making this criticism
are those who believe that the future will see an increase in the number
of independent proprietors. The reply that we would make to them is this:
The only hope of seeing this realised—which is also the ideal of some co-operators—is
to set up producers’ associations under the control and protection of consumers’
societies. In fact, a <i>régime</i> of federated co-operative societies is not incompatible
with the maintenance of a certain amount of autonomous production,
thanks to various considerations which need not be detailed here.</p>

<div class="footnote">

group of credit societies known as the Union Durand. It may be practised by
a few other societies there, but it is quite obviously the exception, whereas in
some German societies and in Italian and Swiss associations the rule is always
followed—another proof that although the idea is French in origin we must look
elsewhere for practical applications.</p>

workman meets with an accident, or falls ill even. They are also liable to damages
whenever they pay off their men. Owners of urban property are no longer
allowed to build according to their fancy, and any property set up in contravention
of the sanitary regulations is immediately demolished. Further progress
along these lines would lead to juridical socialism. See <i>Les Transformations

<i>Das bürgerliche Recht und die besitzlosen Volksklassen</i> (1890). Another of his
works, <i>Das Recht auf den vollen Arbeitsertrag</i>, which has been translated into
English and contains a valuable preface by Professor Foxwell Menger, maintains
that at the basis of the economic order are three fundamental rights which may
be compared with the political demands put forward in the Declaration of the
Rights of Man. These rights are: (1) the right to the whole produce of labour,
(2) the right to work, (3) the right to exist—all of which claims were put forward
by Considérant, Louis Blanc, and Proudhon, the French socialists of 1848.</p>

for new clients—that is, for more persons to whom they can be of service.” These

more than the obligation to attend meetings and to conform to rules.</p>

Solidarity also implies a sacrifice: every appeal on behalf of solidarity is based
upon the consciousness of a certain amount of sacrifice, but a sacrifice that is
not entirely disinterested—it is the sacrifice of a part of the individual self in
order to gain an equal share in the collective being.</p>

Stirner’s real name was Kaspar Schmidt. Born in 1806 at Bayreuth, in
Bavaria, he died at Berlin in extreme poverty and wretchedness in 1856. For

as he was a successor of Stirner’s. But Nietzsche’s interests were always
exclusively philosophical and ethical. Stirner’s work, on the other hand, is
mainly social and political. We have already pointed out that even Stirner’s
book has only a rather remote connection with economics, and a detailed study
of it would be more in keeping with a history of political ideas. Nietzsche’s
work would lead us still farther afield, and would force us to examine every
individualistic doctrine as it cropped up.</p>

the test of reality is surely gross materialism. At this rate, law, custom, and
language would have to be considered unreal. A historical fact such as a battle

written by a syndicalist of the name of Berth, syndicalism and anarchism are
contrasted, Proudhon’s emphasis upon the reality of society being adopted as
the crucial test. Unfortunately, however, Berth confines his examination to
Stirner’s system. Had he applied the test to Bakunin or Kropotkin he would
have discovered that the emphasis laid by them upon the reality of society
constitutes the most original feature in their theory. We are thus driven to
the exactly opposite conclusion, and feel bound to admit—M. Berth notwithstanding—that
anarchism and syndicalism in many respects closely resemble
one another. Jean Grave, however, as we shall see later, seems more favourably
inclined towards the naïve individualism of Stirner.</p>

and everywhere the one cause of all the crimes committed by men, its conduct
in punishing criminals is clearly absurd or obviously insincere. Every punishment
implies guilt, but the criminals in this case are never guilty. We deny
the so-called right of society to bestow punishment in this arbitrary fashion.
A human being is simply the unwilling product of the natural or social environment

The three great causes of human immorality are inequality, whether political,
economic, or social; ignorance, which is its natural result; and slavery, its

which are still unanswerable and which no <i>bourgeois</i> economist has ever attempted
to disprove? What are we to make of property and capital as they exist at
the present moment? In both cases it practically means a right or a power
guaranteed and protected by society to live without working; and since property
and capital produce absolutely nothing unless fertilised by labour, it means
power and the right to live upon the labour of others and to exploit the labour
of those who have neither property nor capital and are compelled to sell their
productive force to the fortunate owner of the one or other of these.” Cf.
Kropotkin’s <i>Conquest of Bread</i>, p. 56: “Multiply examples, choose them where
you will, consider the origin of all fortunes, large or small, whether arising out
of commerce, finance, manufactures, or the land. Everywhere you will find
that the wealth of the wealthy springs from the poverty of the poor.” In this

contention.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1342" id="Footnote_1342"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1342"><span class="label">[1342]</span></a> Bakunin on his death-bed confessed to his friend Reichel that “all his
philosophy had been built upon a false foundation. All was vitiated because
he had begun by taking man as an individual, whereas he is really a member
of a collective whole” (quoted by Guillaume, <i>Œuvres</i>, preface to vol. ii, p. 60).
In his <i>Philosophie du Progrès</i> (<i>Œuvres</i>, vol. xx, pp. 36-38) Proudhon writes as
follows: “All that reason knows and maintains is that the individual, like an
idea, is really a group. All existence is in groups, and whatever forms a group
also forms a unit, and consequently becomes perceptible and is then said to
exist. In accordance with this general conception of being, I think it possible
to prove the existence of positive reality and up to a certain point to demonstrate
the laws of the social being or of the humanitarian group, and to establish a
proof of the existence of an individuality superior to collective man and still
quite other and different from his individual self.” The same idea frequently
comes up in different connections, <i>e.g.</i>, in the <i>Petit Catéchisme politique</i> at
the end of vol. i of <i>La Justice dans la Révolution</i>, and in <i>Idée générale de la
Révolution</i>.</p>

<p>Kropotkin thinks that man has always lived in society of one kind or another.
“As far back as we can go in the palæo-ethnology of mankind, we find men
living in societies, in tribes similar to those of the highest mammals.” (<i>Mutual
Aid</i>, p. 80). “Man did not create society; society is older than man.” (<i>The
State, its Historic Rôle</i>, p. 6; London, 1898.) Jean Grave, on the other hand,
thinks that “the individual was prior to society. Destroy the individual, and
there will be nothing left of society. Let the association be dissolved and the
individuals scattered, they will fare badly and will possibly return to savagery,
their faculties will decay and not progress, but still they will continue to exist.”
(<i>La Societé future</i>, pp. 160-162.) Grave’s view is essentially his own and does not
square with those of either Kropotkin, Bakunin, or Proudhon, the real founders of
anarchy. It is, moreover, quite obvious that their theories are really much
nearer the truth, for it is as impossible to conceive of society without the individual
as it is to conceive of the individual without society. The individual, as
Bakunin emphatically declares, is a fiction, or an abstraction, as Walras would
say. Many people find it difficult to accept this doctrine. But it seems the only
one that tallies with the facts, whether of nature or of history. We can no more
imagine the individual without society than we can a fish without water.
Deprived of water, it is not only less of a fish, but it is no longer a fish at all—except
a dead one.</p>

the worst that has ever befallen the science. The State problem he defines
as follows: “How to inscribe within the great circle which we call society that
other circle called government.” Dunoyer in so many words expresses the same
idea.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1345" id="Footnote_1345"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1345"><span class="label">[1345]</span></a> This idea finds frequent expression both with Reclus and Kropotkin.
“The fact that we have instituted, regulated, codified, and encompassed with
constraints and penalties, with gendarmes and jailers, the larger part of our more
or less incoherent collection of political, religious, moral and social conceptions
of to-day in order to enforce them upon the citizens of to-morrow is in itself
sufficiently absurd, and it is bound to have contradictory results. Life, which is
always improving and renewing itself, can never submit to regulations which have
been drawn up in some period now past.” (Reclus, <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 108-9.) “Anarchist
society,” writes Kropotkin, “is one to which any pre-established, crystallised
form of law will always be repugnant. It is also one which looks for harmony,
which can only be temporary and fugitive perhaps, in the equilibrium between
the mass of different forces and influences of every kind which pursue their
course without the slightest deflection, and which because they are quite
untrammelled beget reaction and arouse those activities which are favourable
to them when they move in the direction of progress.” (<i>L’Anarchie</i>, pp. 17, 18.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1347" id="Footnote_1347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1347"><span class="label">[1347]</span></a> Proudhon had already set the problem as follows: “Can we find a method
of transacting business that will unite divergent interests and identify individuals
with the general well-being, replace the inequality of nature by equality of
education, and remove all political and economic contradictions; when each
individual will be at once both producer and consumer, citizen and sovereign,
ruler and ruled; when liberty will always expand without involving any
counter-loss; when the well being of each will grow indefinitely without
involving any damage to the property, the labour, or the revenue of any of his
fellow-citizens, or of the State itself, without weakening the interests he has in
common with his fellow-men, without alienating their good opinion or destroying
their affection for him?” (<i>Idée générale</i>, p. 145.) Says Jean Grave: “Were
society established on natural bases, individual and general interests would
never conflict.” (<i>Société future</i>, p. 156.)</p>

contract you become a member of the fraternity of free men. In case of
infringement, either on their side or on yours, you are responsible to one another,
and the responsibility might even involve excommunication and death.” (<i>Idée

just after the Tsar Alexander II had accepted the challenge of Liberalism by
emancipating the serfs. But he immediately proceeded to revive the cruel
system of espionage and repression carried out by his father Nicholas I, and so
roused the indignation of the more advanced leaders, who thought that they had
in him a hero who would open the golden gates of liberty. Bakunin at the time
was under the influence of an unscrupulous fanatic of the name of Netchaieff,
whose savage and revolting passion for the execution of criminal deeds in the
name of revolution had completely captivated him. Later on he vigorously
reproved such acts, and declared that they ought to be suppressed.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
